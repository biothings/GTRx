It has been reported in individuals of European and Japanese descent.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Cartilage-hair hypoplasia is a disorder of bone growth characterized by short stature (dwarfism) with other skeletal abnormalities; fine, sparse hair (hypotrichosis); and abnormal immune system function (immune deficiency) that can lead to recurrent infections.People with cartilage-hair hypoplasia have unusually short limbs and short stature from birth. They typically have malformations in the cartilage near the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs (metaphyseal chondrodysplasia), which then affects development of the bone itself. Most people with cartilage-hair hypoplasia are unusually flexible in some joints, but they may have difficulty extending their elbows fully.Affected individuals have hair that is lighter in color than that of other family members because the core of each hair, which contains some of the pigment that contributes the hair's color, is missing. The missing core also makes each strand of hair thinner, causing the hair to have a sparse appearance overall. Unusually light-colored skin (hypopigmentation), malformed nails, and dental abnormalities may also be seen in this disorder.The extent of the immune deficiency in cartilage-hair hypoplasia varies from mild to severe. Affected individuals with the most severe immune problems are considered to have severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi and are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. These infections are often caused by opportunistic organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system. Most people with cartilage-hair hypoplasia, even those who have milder immune deficiency, experience infections of the respiratory system, ears, and sinuses. In particular, the chicken pox virus (varicella) often causes dangerous infections in people with this disorder. Autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs, occur in some people with cartilage-hair hypoplasia. Affected individuals are also at an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly certain skin cancers (basal cell carcinomas), cancer of blood-forming cells (leukemia), and cancer of immune system cells (lymphoma).Some people with cartilage-hair hypoplasia experience gastrointestinal problems. These problems may include an inability to properly absorb nutrients or intolerance of a protein called gluten found in wheat and other grains (celiac disease). Affected individuals may have Hirschsprung disease, an intestinal disorder that causes severe constipation, intestinal blockage, and enlargement of the colon. Narrowing of the anus (anal stenosis) or blockage of the esophagus (esophageal atresia) may also occur."], "alternate_names": ["ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA 1; ANXD1", "CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA; CHH", "Omenn syndrome", "METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS;

It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Unlike many genes, the RMRP gene does not contain instructions for making a protein. Instead, a molecule called a noncoding RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA, is produced from the RMRP gene. Several proteins bind to this RNA molecule, forming an enzyme called mitochondrial RNA-processing endoribonuclease, or RNase MRP. RNase MRP is thought to be involved in several important cellular processes (mitochondrial DNA replication, ribosomal RNA processing, cell cycle control).  RMRP gene mutations, including some of the same mutations that cause cartilage-hair hypoplasia may result in a similar skeletal dysplasia known as metaphyseal dysplasia without hypotrichosis. This condition is characterized by short stature and skeletal abnormalities that are usually less severe than those seen in cartilage-hair hypoplasia. Individuals with metaphyseal dysplasia without hypotrichosis do not have any changes in the structure or appearance of their hair, but they may have immune deficiency and an increased risk of developing cancer. It is unknown why the same mutations may cause both of these conditions. Together with anauxetic dysplasia, they are often referred to as cartilage-hair hypoplasia spectrum disorders, with anauxetic dysplasia as the most severe form and metaphyseal dysplasia without hypertrichosis on the mild end of the spectrum.

Variants in RPL11 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPL11 gene is located at 1p36.11. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPL11 gene encodes ribosomal protein L11. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide.

Variants in RPL15 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPL15 gene is located at 3p24.2. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPL15 gene encodes ribosomal protein L15. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Literature reports suggest that RPL15 associated disease often presents with fetal hydrops. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPL15 causes ~1% of cases.

Variants in RPL18 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPL18 gene is located at 19q13.33. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPL18 gene encodes ribosomal protein L18 which seems to play a role in pre-rRNA processing. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPL18 has been reported in a single family.

Variants in RPL26 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPL26 gene is located at 17p13.1. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPL26 gene encodes ribosomal protein L26. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPL26 causes 2 cases.

Variants in RPL27 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPL27 gene is located at 17q21.31. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPL27 gene encodes ribosomal protein L27 and seems to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA processing. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPL27 has been reported in 2 cases.

Variants in RPL35 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPL35 gene is located at 9q33.3. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPL35 gene encodes ribosomal protein L35. RPL35 appears to function as an endoplasmic reticulum docking protein for the ribosome. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPL35 has been reported in 4 cases.

The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPL35A gene encodes ribosomal protein L35A. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPL35A causes 2-3% of cases.

Variants in RPL5 are the 2nd most common cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPL5 gene is located at 1p22.1. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPL5 gene encodes ribosomal protein L5 which plays an important role in ribosome biogenesis. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. RPL5 mutations seem to cause a more severe clinical phenotype and was the first ribosomal protein gene to be associated with cleft lip and/or cleft palate abnormalities. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide.

This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure.Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate.Thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cells that normally assist with blood clotting. In people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream because a large number of platelets are used to make abnormal clots. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases. These life-threatening complications prevent the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The two disorders have different causes and different signs and symptoms. Unlike the atypical form, the typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce toxic substances called Shiga-like toxins. The typical form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger than 10. The typical form is less likely than the atypical form to involve recurrent attacks of kidney damage that lead to ESRD."], "alternate_names": ["HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME, ATYPICAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 4"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 1037.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "CFB"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Prednisone"}, {"int_description_2": "Dexamethasone"}, {"int_description_3": "Labetalol"}, {"int_description_4": "Doxazosin"}, {"int_description_5": "Amlodipine", "timeframe_int5": "Hours,Days or Weeks,Years", "age_use_int5": "Child", "contra_int5": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug5": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug5": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_6": "Eculizumab"}, {"int_description_7": "Basiliximab"}, {"int_description_8": "Etanercept"}, {"int_description_9": "Cyclosporine"}, {"int_description_10": "Metronidazole"}, {"int_description_11": "Sirolimus"}, {"int_description_12": "Piperacillin"}, {"int_description_13": "Captopril"}, {"int_description_14": "Tazobactam"}, {"int_description_15": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"int_description_16": "Ceftriaxone"}, {"int_description_17": "Nifedipine"}, {"int_description_18": "Vincristine"}, {"int_description_19": "Fluconazole"}, {"int_description_20": "Tacrolimus"}, {"int_description_21": "Azathioprine"}, {"int_description_22": "Mycophenolate mofetil"}, {"int_description_23": "Lansoprazole"}, {"int_description_24": "Methylprednisolone"}, {"int_description_25": "Corticosteroids"}, {"int_description_26": "Iron"}, {"int_description_27": "Calcium carbonate"}, {"int_description_28": "Alginic acid", "timeframe_int28": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int28": "Infant,Child", "contra_int28": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug28": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug28": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_29": "Meningococcal vaccine"}, {"int_description_30": "Serine protease inhibitor", "timeframe_int30": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int30": "Child", "contra_int30": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug30": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug30": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_31": "Sodium bicarbonate"}, {"int_description_32": "Hemodialysis"}, {"int_description_33": "Peritoneal dialysis"}, {"int_description_34": "Plasma exchange"}, {"int_description_35": "Transfusion with packed red cells"}, {"int_description_36": "Bilateral nephrectomy", "timeframe_int36": "Days or Weeks,Years", "age_use_int36": "Infant,Child", "contra_int36": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug36": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug36": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_37": "Kidney transplantation", "timeframe_int37": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int37": "Infant,Child", "contra_int37": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug37": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug37": "Effective / Ameliorative"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "A complement factor B mutation in a large kindred with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.", "pmid_1": 24906628.0, "pmid_date_1": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Journal of clinical immunology"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Eculizumab for the treatment of two recurrences of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in a kidney allograft.", "pmid_2": 22591029.0, "pmid_date_2": 2012.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Complement deficiency states and associated infections.", "pmid_3": 21624663.0, "pmid_date_3": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Molecular immunology"}, {"pmid_title_4": "Insufficient protection by Neisseria meningitidis vaccination alone during eculizumab therapy.", "pmid_4": 21643943.0, "pmid_date_4": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_4": "Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)"}, {"pmid_title_5": "Eculizumab safely reverses neurologic impairment and eliminates need for dialysis in severe atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.", "pmid_5": 22287852.0, "pmid_date_5": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_5": "Clinical pharmacology : advances and applications"}, {"pmid_title_6": "An adult with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome and nephrotic syndrome.", "pmid_6": 16183409.0, "pmid_date_6": 2005.0, "pmid_journal_6": "American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation"}, {"pmid_title_7": "Familial relapsing haemolytic uraemic syndrome and complement factor H deficiency.", "pmid_7": 10344366.0, "pmid_date_7": 1999.0, "pmid_journal_7": "Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association -

Variants in RPS10 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS10 gene is located at 6p21.31. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS10 gene encodes ribosomal protein S10. RPS10 is necessary for production of the 18S rRNA subunit. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS10 causes 1-3% of cases.

Variants in RPS15A are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS15A gene is located at 16p12.3. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS15A gene encodes ribosomal protein S15A. RPS15A is necessary for production of the 18S rRNA subunit. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS15A has been reported in 2 families.

Variants in RPS17 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS17 gene is located at 15q25.2. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS17 gene encodes ribosomal protein S17. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia. In contrast to other genes that cause Diamond-Blackfan anemia, for RPS17, ~2/3 of patients carry a pathogenic deletion or duplication rather than a sequence variant.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS17 causes 1-3% of cases.

Variants in RPS19 are the most common cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS19 gene is located at 19q13.2. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS19 gene encodes ribosomal protein S19, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS19 causes 25-30% of cases.

Variants in RPS24 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS24 gene is located at 10q22.3. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS24 gene encodes ribosomal protein S24, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit . Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS24 causes 2-3% of cases.

Variants in RPS26 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS26 gene is located at 12q13.2. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS26 gene encodes ribosomal protein S26 which is necessary for production of the small 18S rRNA subunit. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS26 causes 6-9% of cases.

Variants in RPS27 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS27 gene is located at 1q21.3. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS27 gene encodes a ribosomal protein, RPS27, which is necessary for production of the 40S rRNA subunit. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS27 has been reported in a single case.

Variants in RPS28 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia with mandibulofacial dysostosis. The RPS28 gene is located at 19p13.2. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The majority of Blackfan-Diamond anemia cases are associated with ribosomal genes.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS28 has been implicated in fewer than 5 cases.

Variants in RPS29 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS29 gene is located at 1p36.11. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS29 gene encodes ribosomal protein S29, a component of the small 40S ribosomal subunit and plays a key role in rRNA processing and ribosomal biogenesis. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS29 causes ~1% of cases.

Variants in RPS7 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The RPS7 gene is located at 2p25.3. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The RPS7 gene encodes ribosomal protein S7 which is believed to be important for maturation of ribosomal RNA. Numerous other ribosomal genes are also associated with Blackfan-Diamond anemia.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. RPS7 causes ~1% of cases.

Other dominant conditions caused by variants in this gene include Non-Dravet Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 6B, Dravet syndrome, Familial Febrile Seizures 3A and Familial Hemiplegic Migraine 3. SCN1A encodes the alpha subunit of the NaV1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel. This channel is found primarily in the brain and controls the inward flow of sodium ions. NaV1.1 channels are involved in transmitting signals from one nerve cell (neuron) to another. Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. The flow of sodium ions through NaV1.1 channels helps determine when neurotransmitters will be released.  Genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a spectrum of seizure disorders of varying severity.  Although GEFS+ can by caused by mutations in a number of genes, it is most commonly associated with pathogenic variants in the SCN1A gene. GEFS+ is usually diagnosed in families whose members have a combination of febrile seizures, which are triggered by a high fever, and epilepsy of other types, including afebrile seizures. The additional seizure types usually are generalized seizures; however, partial seizures occur in some affected individuals. The most common types of seizure in people with GEFS+ include myoclonic seizures and absence seizures. The most common and mildest feature of the GEFS+ spectrum is simple febrile seizures, which begin in infancy and usually stop by age 5. When the febrile seizures continue after age 5 or other types of seizure develop, the condition is called febrile seizures plus (FS+). Seizures in FS+ usually end in early adolescence. A condition called Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or SMEI) is often considered part of the GEFS+ spectrum and is the most severe disorder in this group. Affected infants typically have prolonged seizures lasting several minutes (status epilepticus), which are triggered by fever. Other seizure types, including afebrile seizures, begin in early childhood. These types can include myoclonic or absence seizures. In Dravet syndrome, these seizures are difficult to control with medication, and they can worsen over time. A decline in brain function is also common in Dravet syndrome. Affected individuals usually develop normally in the first year of life, but then development stalls, and some affected children lose already-acquired skills (developmental regression). Many people with Dravet syndrome have difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and intellectual disability. Some people with GEFS+ have seizure disorders of intermediate severity that may not fit into the classical diagnosis of simple febrile seizures, FS+, or Dravet syndrome. Family members with GEFS+ may have different combinations of febrile seizures and epilepsy. For example, one affected family member may have only febrile seizures, while another also has myoclonic epilepsy. While GEFS+ is usually diagnosed in families, it can occur in individuals with no history of the condition in their family.  GEFS+ is a rare condition. Its prevalence is unknown.

About 95% of mutations occur de novo. Variants in the SCN1A gene can also cause generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), which has overlapping features, as well as a more severe disorder- developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-6B.  The SCN1A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels, which transport sodium ions into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. The SCN1A gene provides instructions for making the alpha subunit of the NaV1.1 sodium channel. These channels are primarily found in the brain, where they control the flow of sodium ions into cells. NaV1.1 channels are involved in transmitting signals between neurons. Communication between neurons neurotransmitters. The flow of sodium ions through NaV1.1 channels helps determine when neurotransmitters will be released.  Dravet syndrome is the most severe of a group of conditions known as SCN1A-related seizure disorders. About 85% of cases of Dravet syndrome are caused by pathogenic variants in the SCN1A gene.  Symptoms include seizures which first occur in infancy, usually between 5-8 months of age in previously healthy infants, that are often triggered by fevers.  Presentation may be as febrile status epilepticus. In childhood, usually between the ages of 4 and 11, many types of seizures (focal, atypical absence, clusters of nocturnal tonic or tonic-clonic seizures) may occur and may increase in frequency.  Seizures may be difficult to treat. Seizures can decrease in frequency in adulthood but often remain refractory to therapies. Moderate to severe cognitive impairment and intractable epilepsy into adulthood is common. Children may present with progressive cognitive decline after early language and visual function impairment. Difficulty with movement (gait deterioration) is often present. Intellectual deficiency is present in around 86% of patients. Autism spectrum disorder can also appear in 31%. Preventing the occurrence of convulsive status epilepticus in children may improve the long-term prognosis.   The main goal of treatment is to reduce seizure frequency and prevent status epilepticus. Valproate, clobazam, stiripentol and bromide may control the febrile seizures early in the disease. Bromide is not FDA approved for use in the United States for the treatment of SNC1A-related seizures.  Stiripentol may be effective in reducing the duration and the frequency of seizures in combination with valproate and clobazam. The ketogenic diet, topiramate and levetiracetam may provide substantial efficacy as adjunctive therapy as well as cannabidiol in association with clobazam. Ongoing clinical trials showed substantial efficacy of fenfluramine as an add-on, although this is still experimental. Vagus nerve stimulation can be also considered. Sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine and phenytoin) should be avoided as they worsen seizures. Benzodiazepines are used to treat acute seizures. Children with prominent seizures with falls need protective head gear. Treatment management should be handled by clinicians with expertise in rare and complex epilepsies.  Dravet syndrome affects an estimated 1:15,700 individuals in the U.S. Approximately 80-90% of those, or 1:20,900 individuals, have both an SCN1A mutation and a clinical diagnosis of Dravet Syndrome.

Variants in the SCN1A gene can also cause Dravet syndrome, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and a more severe disorder- developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-6B.  The SCN1A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels, which transport sodium ions into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. The SCN1A gene provides instructions for making the alpha subunit of the NaV1.1 sodium channel. These channels are primarily found in the brain, where they control the flow of sodium ions into cells. NaV1.1 channels are involved in transmitting signals between neurons. Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters. The flow of sodium ions through NaV1.1 channels helps determine when neurotransmitters will be released.  Familial hemiplegic migraine is a form of migraine headache that runs in families. Migraines usually cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and can be triggered by certain foods, emotional stress, and minor head trauma. Each headache may last from a few hours to a few days .In some types of migraine, including familial hemiplegic migraine, a pattern of neurological symptoms called an aura precedes the headache. The most common symptoms associated with an aura are temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In people with familial hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). Additional features of an aura can include difficulty with speech, confusion, and drowsiness. An aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour. Unusually severe migraine episodes have been reported in some people with familial hemiplegic migraine. These episodes have included fever, seizures, prolonged weakness, coma, and, rarely, death. Although most people with familial hemiplegic migraine recover completely between episodes, neurological symptoms such as memory loss and problems with attention can last for weeks or months. About 20 percent of people with this condition develop mild but permanent difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), which may worsen with time, and rapid, involuntary eye movements called nystagmus.

In addition to causing BFNIS, pathogenic variants in SCN2A can cause a more severe epilepsy syndrome, Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 11, characterized by seizures beginning in infancy (before 12 months of age) followed by developmental delay. Pathogenic variants can also cause Autism Spectrum Disorder/ Intellectual Disability (ASD/ID) and Episodic Ataxia Type 9. The former is characterized by global developmental delay (particularly of social and language skills), of which about 1/3 of affected children will develop seizures in childhood sometime around or after 12 months of age. Episodic Ataxia Type 9 is a neurologic disorder characterized by onset of ataxic episodes in the first years of life presenting with intermittent episodes of difficulty walking, dizziness, slurred speech, headache, vomiting, and pain, occurring every few weeks or months and lasting minutes to hours.

Prevalence is unknown. The syndrome is nonprogressive. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the type IV voltage-gated sodium channel (SCN4A; 17q23.3).  Paramyotonia congenita is a disorder that affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Beginning in infancy or early childhood, people with this condition experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent muscles from relaxing normally. Myotonia causes muscle stiffness that typically appears after exercise and can be induced by muscle cooling. This stiffness chiefly affects muscles in the face, neck, arms, and hands, although it can also affect muscles used for breathing and muscles in the lower body. Unlike many other forms of myotonia, the muscle stiffness associated with paramyotonia congenita tends to worsen with repeated movements.Most people-even those without muscle disease-feel that their muscles do not work as well when they are cold. This effect is dramatic in people with paramyotonia congenita. Exposure to cold initially causes muscle stiffness in these individuals, and prolonged cold exposure leads to temporary episodes of mild to severe muscle weakness that may last for several hours at a time. Some older people with paramyotonia congenita develop permanent muscle weakness that can be disabling.  . The aim of treatment is to reduce the intensity of acute symptoms and to prevent, as far as possible, further attacks. Some attacks are so mild that treatment is not necessary. However, in other instances drug therapy is required.The treatment of PMC is based on the individual's symptoms; PMC can be handled on a day-to-day basis and many patients can lead normal lives. Individuals must be cautious to sudden exposures to very cold weather, as well as avoiding sudden heavy physical activity. Muscle stiffness could also be triggered or enhanced by potassium-rich foods. Patients need to learn how to manage their potassium-intake. They should avoid potassium-rich foods, avoid skipping meals and take carbohydrate rich snacks in between meals. Treatment with medications that block the sodium channels such as mexiletine and lamotrigine may help reduce the stiffness related to myotonia. Some patients with PMC may benefit from acetazolamide or thiazide diuretic drugs to reduce the number of paralytic attacks.

This stiffness chiefly affects muscles in the face, neck, arms, and hands, although it can also affect muscles used for breathing and muscles in the lower body. Unlike many other forms of myotonia, the muscle stiffness associated with paramyotonia congenita tends to worsen with repeated movements.Most people-even those without muscle disease-feel that their muscles do not work as well when they are cold. This effect is dramatic in people with paramyotonia congenita. Exposure to cold initially causes muscle stiffness in these individuals, and prolonged cold exposure leads to temporary episodes of mild to severe muscle weakness that may last for several hours at a time. Some older people with paramyotonia congenita develop permanent muscle weakness that can be disabling."], "alternate_names": ["NORMOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS", "PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA OF VON EULENBURG; PMC", "HYPOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, TYPE 2; HOKPP2", "MYOTONIA, POTASSIUM-AGGRAVATED", "HYPERKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS; HYPP", "MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 16; CMS16"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 10591.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "SCN4A"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Pacemaker"}, {"int_description_2": "Salbutamol", "timeframe_int2": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int2": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int2": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug2": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug2": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_3": "Lidocaine"}, {"int_description_4": "Mexiletine"}, {"int_description_5": "Carbamazepine"}, {"int_description_6": "Hydrochlorothiazide", "timeframe_int6": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int6": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int6": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug6": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug6": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_7": "Acetazolamide"}, {"int_description_8": "Chlorothiazide"}, {"int_description_9": "Flecainide"}, {"int_description_10": "Ranolazine"}, {"int_description_11": "Potassium chloride"}, {"int_description_12": "Potassium"}, {"int_description_13": "\u03b1-[(2-methylphenoxy)methyl]-benzenemethanamine (Me7)"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Prolonged attacks of weakness with hypokalemia in SCN4A-related paramyotonia congenita.", "pmid_1": 30028520.0, "pmid_date_1": 2018.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Muscle & nerve"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Whole-Body Muscle MRI in Patients with Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis Carrying the SCN4A Mutation T704M: Evidence for Chronic Progressive Myopathy with Selective Muscle Involvement.", "pmid_2": 26256659.0, "pmid_date_2": 2015.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Journal of clinical neurology (Seoul, Korea)"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Imaging alterations in skeletal muscle channelopathies: a study in 15 patients.", "pmid_3": 27199537.0, "pmid_date_3": 2015.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Acta myologica : myopathies and cardiomyopathies : official journal of the Mediterranean Society of Myology"}, {"pmid_title_4": "Clinical experience with long-term acetazolamide treatment in children with nondystrophic myotonias: a three-case report.", "pmid_4": 25042881.0, "pmid_date_4": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_4": "Pediatric neurology"}, {"pmid_title_5": "Severe phenotypes of paralysis periodica paramyotonia are associated with the Met1592Val mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (SCN4A) in a Chinese family.", "pmid_5": 21665479.0, "pmid_date_5": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_5": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia"}, {"pmid_title_6": "Ranolazine block of human Na v 1.4 sodium channels and paramyotonia congenita mutants.", "pmid_6": 21317558.0, "pmid_date_6": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_6": "Channels (Austin, Tex.)"}, {"pmid_title_7": "Preferred mexiletine block of human sodium channels with IVS4 mutations and its pH-dependence.", "pmid_7": 15864116.0, "pmid_date_7": 2005.0, "pmid_journal_7": "Pharmacogenetics and genomics"}, {"pmid_title_8": "Different flecainide sensitivity of hNav1.4 channels and myotonic mutants explained by state-dependent block.", "pmid_8": 14608015.0, "pmid_date_8": 2004.0, "pmid_journal_8": "The Journal of physiology"}, {"pmid_title_9": "Severe infantile hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis and paramyotonia congenita: broadening the clinical spectrum associated with the T704M mutation in SCN4A.", "pmid_9": 12933953.0, "pmid_date_9": 2003.0, "pmid_journal_9": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry"}, {"pmid_title_10": "Gating of myotonic Na channel mutants defines the response to mexiletine and a potent derivative.", "pmid_10": 11723275.0, "pmid_date_10": 2001.0, "pmid_journal_10": "Neurology"}, {"pmid_title_11": "Paramyotonia congenita: genotype to phenotype correlations in two families and report of a new mutation in the sodium channel gene.", "pmid_11": 8902732.0, "pmid_date_11": 1996.0, "pmid_journal_11": "Journal of the neurological sciences"}, {"pmid_title_12": "Two human paramyotonia congenita mutations have opposite effects on lidocaine block of Na+ channels expressed in a mammalian cell line.", "pmid_12": 8910215.0, "pmid_date_12": 1996.0, "pmid_journal_12": "The Journal of physiology"}]}, {"_id": "10591-OMIM:170500", "condition": {"condition_name": "HYPERKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS; HYPP", "freq_per_birth": "Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis affects an estimated 1 in 200,000 people.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal dominant", "clinical_summary": ["Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is a rare condition, caused by dominant mutations in the SCN4A gene (17q23.3), that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness or paralysis, usually beginning in infancy or early childhood.

Normokalemic period paralysis is the rarest subtype of periodic paralysis. It is clinically and biochemically similar to hyperkalemic periodic paralysis leading some authors to suggest that is a variant of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, rather than a subtype.  The main clinical characteristic of NormoPP is episodic mild proximal muscle weakness lasting from 0.5 days to 4 weeks. Other clinical features may include calf hypertrophy, percussion myotonia of the thenar muscles and mild eye lid myotonia. Recurrent respiratory muscle paralysis with shortness of breath has been reported in one patient. Age of onset of symptoms is variable, ranging between 1-20 years of age, with precipitating factors of cold/wet weather, changes in season, strenuous exercise, stress or infection. Acutely, treatment is provision of a normal saline solution. Long-term therapy may include a high sodium diet and hydrochlorothiazide or acetazolamide.

A normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. These signals begin in a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker) located in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). From there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of His. This bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). Electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria.Heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. In people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. Partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat (bradycardia or arrhythmia, respectively), and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the cells that carry electrical impulses. Fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. Complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, fainting (syncope), or sudden cardiac arrest and death.Progressive familial heart block can be divided into type I and type II, with type I being further divided into types IA and IB. These types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. In types IA and IB, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type II, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. The different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms.Most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. The most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs as a normal process of aging.

The SCN5A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels.

The sodium channels containing proteins produced from the SCN5A gene are abundant in heart (cardiac) muscle cells and play key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. These channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the upper and lower chambers of the heart, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm. More than 400 mutations in the SCN5A gene have been identified in people with Brugada syndrome, a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm. Specifically, this disorder can lead to ventricular arrhythmia. If untreated, the irregular heartbeats can cause syncope, seizures, difficulty breathing, or sudden death. These complications typically occur when an affected person is resting or asleep. Brugada syndrome usually becomes apparent in adulthood, although it can develop any time throughout life. Signs and symptoms related to arrhythmias, including sudden death, can occur from early infancy to late adulthood. Sudden death typically occurs around age 40.

If the source of ventricular ectopy is identified, endocardial ablation is an option.

The SCN5A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels open and close at specific times to control the flow of sodium ions into cells. The sodium channels containing proteins produced from the SCN5A gene are abundant in cardiac muscle cells and play key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. These channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the upper and lower chambers of the heart, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm. SCN5A encodes the alpha subunit of voltage-gated sodium channel type V. . Channels made with these altered SCN5A proteins stay open longer than usual, which allows sodium ions to continue flowing into cardiac muscle cells abnormally. This delay in channel closure alters the transmission of electrical signals in the heart, increasing the risk of an irregular heartbeat that can cause syncope or sudden death. At least 238 mutations in the SCN5A gene are known to cause Romano-Ward syndrome, which is the most common form of an arrhythmia called long QT syndrome. Mutations in this gene account for five to 10 percent of cases of Romano-Ward syndrome. In individuals with this condition the cardiac muscle takes longer than usual to recharge between beats.  In people with Long QT syndrome, also known as Romano-Ward syndrome, the QT interval is abnormally long and the heart muscle takes longer than usual to repolarize between beats resulting in abnormal heart rhythms.  Although cardiac events may present anytime from infancy through middle age, they are most commonly seen in the preteen years through the 20s.  It has been proposed that SCN5A long QT syndrome may be severe than the other forms. The primary treatment for long QT syndrome is pharmacologic with beta-blockers and/or sodium channel blockers in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals who meet diagnostic criteria. Propranolol is the preferred beta blocker in SCN5A-related long QT syndrome. Beta blocking agents may be pro-arrhythmic and poorly efficient. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators may be indicated for those with beta-blocker resistant symptoms, for those who cannot take beta blockers or for those with a history of cardiac arrest.    Romano-Ward syndrome is the most common form of inherited long QT syndrome, which affects an estimated 1 in 2,000 people worldwide . Mutations in SCN5A account for five to 10 percent of cases of Romano-Ward syndrome.", "Romano-Ward syndrome is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). This disorder is a form of long QT syndrome, which is a heart condition that causes the heart (cardiac) muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. The term long QT refers to a specific pattern of heart activity that is detected with an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which is a test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. In people with long QT syndrome, the part of the heartbeat known as the QT interval is abnormally long. Abnormalities in the time it takes to recharge the heart lead to abnormal heart rhythms.The arrhythmia associated with Romano-Ward syndrome can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest and sudden death. However, some people with Romano-Ward syndrome never experience any health problems associated with the condition.Fifteen types of long QT syndrome have been defined based on their genetic cause.

Sick sinus syndrome 1 is an autosomal recessive condition. The SCN5A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels open and close at specific times to control the flow of positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells. The sodium channels containing proteins produced from the SCN5A gene are abundant in heart (cardiac) muscle cells and play key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. These channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the upper and lower chambers of the heart, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm. At least 16 mutations in the SCN5A gene have been found to cause another heart condition called sick sinus syndrome. This condition affects the function of the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart that functions as a natural pacemaker. The SCN5A gene mutations that cause sick sinus syndrome lead to the production of nonfunctional sodium channels or abnormal channels that cannot transport ions properly. The flow of these ions is essential for creating the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat and spread these signals to other areas of the heart. Mutations reduce the flow of sodium ions, which alters the SA node's ability to create and spread electrical signals. These changes increase the risk of abnormally fast or slow heartbeats, which can cause dizziness, light-headedness, syncope, and related symptoms.  Sick sinus syndrome tends to cause the heartbeat to be too slow (bradycardia), although occasionally the heartbeat is too fast (tachycardia). In some cases, the heartbeat rapidly switches from being too fast to being too slow, a condition known as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. Symptoms related to abnormal heartbeats can include dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope), a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), and confusion or memory problems. During exercise, many affected individuals experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or excessive tiredness (fatigue). Once symptoms of sick sinus syndrome appear, they usually worsen with time. However, some people with the condition never experience any related health problems.  Sick sinus syndrome occurs most commonly in older adults, although it can be diagnosed in people of any age. The condition increases the risk of several life-threatening problems involving the heart and blood vessels. These include a heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and stroke. Treatment often includes pacemaker implantation, although a retrospective case-control study published in 2019 demonstrated that cilostazol increased heart rate and was effective in avoiding permanent pacemaker  implantation.  ", "Sick sinus syndrome (also known as sinus node dysfunction) is a group of related heart conditions that can affect how the heart beats. Sick sinus refers to the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart that functions as a natural pacemaker. The SA node generates electrical impulses that start each heartbeat. These signals travel from the SA node to the rest of the heart, signaling the heart (cardiac) muscle to contract and pump blood. In people with sick sinus syndrome, the SA node does not function normally. In some cases, it does not produce the right signals to trigger a regular heartbeat. In others, abnormalities disrupt the electrical impulses and prevent them from reaching the rest of the heart.Sick sinus syndrome tends to cause the heartbeat to be too slow (bradycardia), although occasionally the heartbeat is too fast (tachycardia).

PHA1 caused by variants in SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, while that caused by NR3C2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. SCNN1A is located on chromosome 12p13.31. The SCNN1A gene provides instructions for making the alpha subunit of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The channel is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. These channels are found at the surface of epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells. In the kidney, ENaC channels transport sodium into cells in response to signals that sodium levels are too low. Sodium is thus reabsorbed rather than excreted by the kidney. In addition to regulating the amount of sodium in the body, the flow of sodium ions helps control the movement of water in tissues. For example, ENaC channels in lung cells help regulate the amount of fluid in the lungs.  Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a condition characterized by problems regulating the amount of sodium in the body. Sodium regulation, which is important for blood pressure and fluid balance, primarily occurs in the kidneys. However, sodium can also be removed from the body through other tissues, such as the sweat glands and colon. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is named for its characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of a hormone called aldosterone that helps regulate sodium levels. However, people with PHA1 have high levels of aldosterone. There are two types of PHA1 distinguished by their severity, the genes involved, and how they are inherited. One type, called autosomal dominant PHA1 (also known as renal PHA1) is characterized by excessive sodium loss from the kidneys. This form of the condition is relatively mild and often improves in early childhood. The other type, called autosomal recessive PHA1 (also known as generalized or systemic PHA1) is characterized by sodium loss from the kidneys and other organs, including the sweat glands, salivary glands, and colon. This type of PHA1 is more severe and does not improve with age. The earliest signs of both types of PHA1 are usually failure to thrive and dehydration, which are typically seen in infants. The characteristic feature of both types of PHA1 is urinary salt wasting, which leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Infants with PHA1 can also have metabolic acidosis. Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle weakness in infants with PHA1. Infants with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have additional signs and symptoms due to the involvement of multiple organs. Affected individuals may experience episodes of cardiac arrhythmias or shock because of the imbalance of salts in the body. They may also have recurrent lung infections or lesions on the skin. Although adults with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have repeated episodes of salt wasting, they do not usually have other signs and symptoms of the condition.  SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes result in reduced functioning or nonfunctioning ENaC channels. The reduction or absence of ENaC function in the kidneys leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. In addition, nonfunctional ENaC channels in other body systems lead to additional signs and symptoms of autosomal recessive PHA1. This condition typically begins in infancy and is characterized by hyponatremia and hyperkalemia and severe dehydration. The reduced function of ENaC channels in lung epithelial cells leads to excess fluid in the lungs and recurrent lung infections. SCNN1A-related PHA1 is a severe form of PHA1 and does not improve with age.     Treatment of PHA1 includes stabilization of the initial condition (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) and rectification of dehydration.  Sodium supplementation is provided to rectify sodium deficits. Hyperkalemia can be acutely treated with calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, salbutamol (iv or nebulized) or insulin + glucose. Bicarbonate may be required to regulate acidosis. Hyperkalemia may also be treated with potassium exchange resins or, in severe cases, peritoneal dialysis. Indomethacin has been used with some success to reduce sodium requirements. Hydrochlorothiazide has also been used, with some success, to prevent nephrocalcinosis and to reduce kayexalate requirements. A low-potassium, high sodium diet is also part of treatment.  PHA1 is a rare condition that has been estimated to affect 1 in 80,000 newborns. The exact prevalence of PHA1 caused by variants in SCNN1A is not known.  ", "Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a condition characterized by problems regulating the amount of sodium in the body. Sodium regulation, which is important for blood pressure and fluid balance, primarily occurs in the kidneys. However, sodium can also be removed from the body through other tissues, such as the sweat glands and colon. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is named for its characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of a hormone called aldosterone that helps regulate sodium levels. However, people with PHA1 have high levels of aldosterone.There are two types of PHA1 distinguished by their severity, the genes involved, and how they are inherited. One type, called autosomal dominant PHA1 (also known as renal PHA1) is characterized by excessive sodium loss from the kidneys. This form of the condition is relatively mild and often improves in early childhood. The other type, called autosomal recessive PHA1 (also known as generalized or systemic PHA1) is characterized by sodium loss from the kidneys and other organs, including the sweat glands, salivary glands, and colon. This type of PHA1 is more severe and does not improve with age.The earliest signs of both types of PHA1 are usually the inability to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and dehydration, which are typically seen in infants. The characteristic features of both types of PHA1 are excessive amounts of sodium released in the urine (salt wasting), which leads to low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia), and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). Infants with PHA1 can also have high levels of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis). Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness in infants with PHA1.Infants with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have additional signs and symptoms due to the involvement of multiple organs. Affected individuals may experience episodes of abnormal heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia) or shock because of the imbalance of salts in the body. They may also have recurrent lung infections or lesions on the skin. Although adults with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have repeated episodes of salt wasting, they do not usually have other signs and symptoms of the condition."], "alternate_names": ["LIDDLE SYNDROME

The SCNN1A gene provides instructions for making the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The channel is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. These channels are found at the surface of epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells.  Liddle syndrome is an inherited form of hypertension. This condition is characterized by severe hypertension that begins unusually early in life, often in childhood, although some affected individuals are not diagnosed until adulthood. Some people with Liddle syndrome have no additional signs or symptoms, especially in childhood. Over time, however, untreated hypertension can lead to heart disease or stroke, which may be fatal. In addition to hypertension, affected individuals can have hypokalemia. Signs and symptoms of hypokalemia include muscle weakness or pain, fatigue, constipation, or heart palpitations. The shortage of potassium can also raise the pH of the blood causing metabolic alkalosis. Mutations in the SCNN1A gene have recently been identified as a rare cause of Liddle syndrome. As with the other forms of Liddle syndrome caused by variants in SCNN1B and SCNN1G, variants in SCNN1A result in increased protein stability; thus, the protein is not degraded normally and more ENaC channels remain on the cell surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium (followed by water), which leads to hypertension. Reabsorption of sodium into the blood is linked with removal of potassium from the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia.  Treatment for Liddle syndrome consists of following a low sodium diet and taking potassium-sparing diuretics (triamterene,amiloride) which reduce blood pressure and correct hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

["Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) can be caused by variants in any of four different genes: SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G or NR3C2.  PHA1 caused by variants in SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, while that caused by NR3C2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. SCNN1B is located on chromosome 16p12.2. The SCNN1B gene provides instructions for making the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The channel is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. These channels are found at the surface of epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, colon, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells. In the kidney, ENaC channels open in response to signals that sodium levels in the blood are too low, which allows sodium to flow into cells. From the kidney cells, this sodium is reabsorbed to the bloodstream rather than being excreted in urine. In addition to regulating the amount of sodium in the body, the flow of sodium ions helps control the movement of water in tissues. For example, ENaC channels in lung cells help regulate the amount of fluid in the lungs.  Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a condition characterized by problems regulating the amount of sodium in the body. Sodium regulation, which is important for blood pressure and fluid balance, primarily occurs in the kidneys. However, sodium can also be removed from the body through other tissues, such as the sweat glands and colon. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is named for its characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of a hormone called aldosterone that helps regulate sodium levels. However, people with PHA1 have high levels of aldosterone. There are two types of PHA1 distinguished by their severity, the genes involved, and how they are inherited. One type, called autosomal dominant PHA1 (also known as renal PHA1) is characterized by excessive sodium loss from the kidneys. This form of the condition is relatively mild and often improves in early childhood. The other type, called autosomal recessive PHA1 (also known as generalized or systemic PHA1) is characterized by sodium loss from the kidneys and other organs, including the sweat glands, salivary glands, and colon. This type of PHA1 is more severe and does not improve with age. The earliest signs of both types of PHA1 are usually failure to thrive and dehydration, which are typically seen in infants. The characteristic feature of both types of PHA1 is urinary salt wasting, which leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Infants with PHA1 can also have metabolic acidosis. Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle weakness in infants with PHA1. Infants with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have additional signs and symptoms due to the involvement of multiple organs. Affected individuals may experience episodes of cardiac arrhythmias or shock because of the imbalance of salts in the body. They may also have recurrent lung infections or lesions on the skin. Although adults with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have repeated episodes of salt wasting, they do not usually have other signs and symptoms of the condition.  SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes result in reduced functioning or nonfunctioning ENaC channels. The reduction or absence of ENaC function in the kidneys leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. In addition, nonfunctional ENaC channels in other body systems lead to additional signs and symptoms of autosomal recessive PHA1. This condition typically begins in infancy and is characterized by hyponatremia and hyperkalemia and severe dehydration. The reduced function of ENaC channels in lung epithelial cells leads to excess fluid in the lungs and recurrent lung infections. SCNN1B-related PHA1 is a severe form of PHA1 and does not improve with age.     Treatment of PHA1 includes stabilization of the initial condition (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) and rectification of dehydration.  Sodium supplementation is provided to rectify sodium deficits. Hyperkalemia can be acutely treated with calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, salbutamol (iv or nebulized) or insulin + glucose. Bicarbonate may be required to regulate acidosis. Hyperkalemia may also be treated with potassium exchange resins or, in severe cases, peritoneal dialysis. Indomethacin has been used with some success to reduce sodium requirements. Hydrochlorothiazide has also been used, with some success, to prevent nephrocalcinosis and to reduce kayexalate requirements. A low-potassium, high sodium diet is also part of treatment.  PHA1 is a rare condition that has been estimated to affect 1 in 80,000 newborns. The prevalence of SCNN1B-related PHA1 is unknown.

"pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive, Autosomal dominant", "clinical_summary": ["Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) can be caused by variants in any of four different genes: SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G or NR3C2.  PHA1 caused by variants in SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, while that caused by NR3C2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. SCNN1G is located on chromosome 16p12.2 The SCNN1G gene provides instructions for making the gamma subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The channel is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. These channels are found at the surface of epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells. In the kidney, ENaC channels open in response to signals that sodium levels in the blood are too low, which allows sodium to flow into cells. From the kidney cells, this sodium is reabsorbed to the bloodstream rather than being excreted in urine. In addition to regulating the amount of sodium in the body, the flow of sodium ions helps control the movement of water in tissues. For example, ENaC channels in lung cells help regulate the amount of fluid in the lungs.  Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a condition characterized by problems regulating the amount of sodium in the body. Sodium regulation, which is important for blood pressure and fluid balance, primarily occurs in the kidneys. However, sodium can also be removed from the body through other tissues, such as the sweat glands and colon. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is named for its characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of a hormone called aldosterone that helps regulate sodium levels. However, people with PHA1 have high levels of aldosterone. There are two types of PHA1 distinguished by their severity, the genes involved, and how they are inherited. One type, called autosomal dominant PHA1 (also known as renal PHA1) is characterized by excessive sodium loss from the kidneys. This form of the condition is relatively mild and often improves in early childhood. The other type, called autosomal recessive PHA1 (also known as generalized or systemic PHA1) is characterized by sodium loss from the kidneys and other organs, including the sweat glands, salivary glands, and colon. This type of PHA1 is more severe and does not improve with age. The earliest signs of both types of PHA1 are usually failure to thrive and dehydration, which are typically seen in infants. The characteristic feature of both types of PHA1 is urinary salt wasting, which leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Infants with PHA1 can also have metabolic acidosis. Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle weakness in infants with PHA1. Infants with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have additional signs and symptoms due to the involvement of multiple organs. Affected individuals may experience episodes of cardiac arrhythmias or shock because of the imbalance of salts in the body. They may also have recurrent lung infections or lesions on the skin. Although adults with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have repeated episodes of salt wasting, they do not usually have other signs and symptoms of the condition.  SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes result in reduced functioning or nonfunctioning ENaC channels. The reduction or absence of ENaC function in the kidneys leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. In addition, nonfunctional ENaC channels in other body systems lead to additional signs and symptoms of autosomal recessive PHA1. This condition typically begins in infancy and is characterized by hyponatremia and hyperkalemia and severe dehydration. The reduced function of ENaC channels in lung epithelial cells leads to excess fluid in the lungs and recurrent lung infections. SCNN1G-related PHA1 is a severe form of PHA1 and does not improve with age.   Treatment of PHA1 includes stabilization of the initial condition (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) and rectification of dehydration.  Sodium supplementation is provided to rectify sodium deficits. Hyperkalemia can be acutely treated with calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, salbutamol (iv or nebulized) or insulin + glucose. Bicarbonate may be required to regulate acidosis. Hyperkalemia may also be treated with potassium exchange resins or, in severe cases, peritoneal dialysis. Indomethacin has been used with some success to reduce sodium requirements. Hydrochlorothiazide has also been used, with some success, to prevent nephrocalcinosis and to reduce kayexalate requirements. A low-potassium, high sodium diet is also part of treatment.  PHA1 is a rare condition that has been estimated to affect 1 in 80,000 newborns. The prevalence of SCNN1G-related PHA1 is unknown.

dominant", "clinical_summary": ["Liddle syndrome 2 is an autosomal dominant condition caused by variants in the SCNN1G gene located on chromosome 16p12.2. The SCNN1G gene provides instructions for making the gamma subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The channel is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. These channels are found at the surface of epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells.  Liddle syndrome is an inherited form of hypertension. This condition is characterized by severe hypertension that begins unusually early in life, often in childhood, although some affected individuals are not diagnosed until adulthood. Some people with Liddle syndrome have no additional signs or symptoms, especially in childhood. Over time, however, untreated hypertension can lead to heart disease or stroke, which may be fatal. In addition to hypertension, affected individuals can have hypokalemia. Signs and symptoms of hypokalemia include muscle weakness or pain, fatigue, constipation, or heart palpitations. The shortage of potassium can also raise the pH of the blood causing metabolic alkalosis. At least 5 mutations in the SCNN1G gene are known to cause Liddle syndrome. These variants result in increased protein stability; thus, the protein is not degraded normally and more ENaC channels remain on the cell surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium (followed by water), which leads to hypertension. Reabsorption of sodium into the blood is linked with removal of potassium from the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia.  Treatment for Liddle syndrome consists of following a low sodium diet and taking potassium-sparing diuretics (triamterene,amiloride) which reduce blood pressure and correct hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Conventional anti-hypertensive therapies are not effective for this condition  Liddle syndrome is a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown. The condition has been found in populations worldwide.

The SH2D1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) associated protein (SAP). SAP interacts with SLAM family receptors to activate signaling pathways involved in the control of lymphocytes. It helps regulate cytotoxic lymphocytes and is necessary for the development of natural killer T cells. SAP also helps control immune reactions by triggering apoptosis of lymphocytes when they are no longer needed.  X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is a disorder of the immune system and blood-forming cells that is found almost exclusively in males. More than half of individuals with this disorder experience an exaggerated immune response to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Normally, after initial infection, EBV remains as a latent infection in B cells. However, the virus is generally latent because it is controlled by  T cells that specifically target EBV-infected B cells. People with XLP may respond to EBV infection by producing abnormally large numbers of T cells, B cells, and macrophages. This proliferation of immune cells often causes a life-threatening reaction called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis causes fever, destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, and damages the liver. The spleen, heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues may also be affected. In some individuals with XLP, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or related symptoms may occur without EBV infection. About one-third of people with XLP experience dysgammaglobulinemia. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are proteins that attach to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. Individuals with dysgammaglobulinemia are prone to recurrent infections. Cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas) occur in about one-third of people with XLP. Without treatment, most people with XLP survive only into childhood. Death usually results from hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. XLP can be divided into two types based on its genetic cause and pattern of signs and symptoms: mutations in SH2D1A cause XLP1, also known as classic XLP.   More than 70 SH2D1A gene mutations have been identified in people with XLP. Some SH2D1A gene mutations impair SAP function. Others result in unstable or nonfunctional proteins or abolish SAP production. The loss of functional SAP disrupts proper control of the immune system and may result in the life-threatening immune reaction to Epstein-Barr virus infection that occurs in this disorder. In addition, lymphomas may develop in affected individuals when defective lymphocytes are not properly destroyed by apoptosis.  Treatment of XLP-related HLH is similar to that of other life-threatening genetic hemophagocytic disorders, including immunosuppressive agents such as steroids and etoposide or anti-thymocyte globulin (HLH-94 protocol). Rituximab therapy has been used when HLH is associated with EBV infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia is treated with IVIG replacement therapy. The only curative treatment is allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which should be considered in most individuals as early as possible.  XLP1 is estimated to occur in about 1 per million males worldwide.

Clinical characteristics of SI deficiency include stomach cramps, bloating, excess gas production and diarrhea which may lead to poor weight gain, failure to thrive and malnutrition. Onset of symptoms usually becomes apparent when an infant is weaned and is introduced to fruits, juices and grains. More pronounced symptoms are seen in infants and young children than adults because the diet of younger individuals often includes a higher carbohydrate intake and intestinal digestion occurs more rapidly in infants or young children. The development of renal calculi may complicate SI deficiency. Affected individuals may exhibit irritability, colic, irritation or excoriation of the skin on the buttocks because of prolonged diarrhea episodes and/or vomiting. Treatment for this condition is dietary modification to reduce the ingested amount of sucrose and other complex sugars. Dietary modification can be difficult; treatment with sacrosidase, an FDA approved oral enzyme replacement therapy which must be taken with every meal or snack, has been proven to be effective in treating this disorder.

The SLC16A1 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1). This transporter facilitates the movement of lactate and pyruvate across cell membranes. The SLC16A1 gene is usually transcriptionally silenced in beta cells. Most causative pathogenic variants have been located in the promoter region, however, intragenic gain of function mutations in the SLC16A1 gene have been described in the literature. These variants result in increased beta cell MCT1 expression, which allows circulating lactate and pyruvate to enter the beta cells, fueling the TCA cycle within the mitochondria and inappropriately promoting insulin secretion.     EIHI patients usually present during childhood with recurring episodes of hypoglycemia associated with elevated insulin levels, within 30 minutes of a short period of anaerobic exercise. This response may be mimicked by the injection of pyruvate. The degree of hypoglycemia associated with exercise is variable and tends to be responsive to diazoxide. At least one case of neonatal congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with an intragenic pathogenic variant has been reported in the literature (PMID 28491926).

Researchers have described two subtypes of D-2-HGA, type I and type II. The two subtypes are distinguished by their genetic cause and pattern of inheritance, although they also have some differences in signs and symptoms. Type II tends to begin earlier and often causes more severe health problems than type I. Type II may also be associated with a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), a feature that is typically not found with type I.L-2-HGA particularly affects a region of the brain called the cerebellum, which is involved in coordinating movements. As a result, many affected individuals have problems with balance and muscle coordination (ataxia).

The SLC25A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. The SLC25A1 protein transports citrate out of mitochondria in exchange for malate, which is transported in. Within mitochondria, both citrate and malate participate in reactions that produce energy for cell activities. Citrate is transported out of mitochondria because it also has important functions in other parts of the cell. In particular, citrate is involved in the production of fats (lipids) and the regulation of glycolysis, which is another critical energy-producing process within cells.  The congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders caused by mutations which lead to impaired neuromuscular transmission.

Two types of citrullinemia have been described; they have different signs and symptoms and are caused by mutations in different genes.Type I citrullinemia (also known as classic citrullinemia) usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up, they experience a progressive lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Some affected individuals develop serious liver problems. The health problems associated with type I citrullinemia are life-threatening in many cases. Less commonly, a milder form of type I citrullinemia can develop later in childhood or adulthood. This later-onset form is associated with intense headaches, blind spots (scotomas), problems with balance and muscle coordination (ataxia), and lethargy. Some people with gene mutations that cause type I citrullinemia never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder.Type II citrullinemia chiefly affects the nervous system, causing confusion, restlessness, memory loss, abnormal behaviors (such as aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity), seizures, and coma. Affected individuals often have specific food preferences, preferring protein-rich and fatty foods and avoiding carbohydrate-rich foods. The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically appear during adulthood (adult-onset) and can be triggered by certain medications, infections, surgery, and alcohol intake. These signs and symptoms can be life-threatening in people with adult-onset type II citrullinemia.Adult-onset type II citrullinemia may also develop in people who as infants had a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). This liver condition is also known as neonatal-onset type II citrullinemia. NICCD blocks the flow of bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver) and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of NICCD go away within a year. In rare cases, affected individuals develop other signs and symptoms in early childhood after seeming to recover from NICCD, including delayed growth, extreme tiredness (fatigue), specific food preferences (mentioned above), and abnormal amounts of fats (lipids) in the blood (dyslipidemia). This condition is known as failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD).

The SLC25A15 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mitochondrial ornithine transporter 1. Mitochondrial ornithine transporter 1 is needed to move a molecule called ornithine within the mitochondria. Specifically, this protein transports ornithine across the inner membrane of mitochondria to the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a sequence of biochemical reactions that occurs in liver cells wherein excess nitrogen, made when protein is broken down by the body, is metabolized to make urea that is excreted by the kidneys in urine. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic, especially to the nervous system. Ornithine translocase deficiency causes accumulation of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), which is toxic in high levels.  Impaired ornithine transport also causes ornithine to accumulate in the blood (hyperornithinemia). In addition, homocitrulline, another by-product, is excreted in the urine (homocitrullinuria).   Ornithine translocase deficiency varies widely in its severity and age of onset. Affected infants show signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency within days after birth. In most affected individuals, however, signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency do not appear until later in life, with health problems first appearing any time from childhood to adulthood. Later-onset forms of ornithine translocase deficiency are usually less severe than the infantile form. Infants with ornithine translocase deficiency may be lethargic, refuse to eat, vomit frequently, or have poorly controlled breathing or body temperature. Seizures or unusual body movements are common in these individuals. Some people with this condition have intellectual disability or developmental delay, but others have normal intelligence. Severe cases may result in coma.   Some people with later-onset ornithine translocase deficiency have episodes of vomiting, lethargy, ataxia, vision problems, episodes of brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), developmental delay, learning disabilities, or spasticity. Affected individuals may have chronic liver problems and mild abnormal bleeding.   Individuals with ornithine translocase deficiency often cannot tolerate high-protein foods, such as meat. Occasionally, high-protein meals or stress caused by illness or periods of fasting may cause ammonia to accumulate more quickly in the blood. This rapid increase of ammonia likely leads to the signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency. While the signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency can vary greatly among affected individuals, proper treatment can prevent some complications from occurring and may improve quality of life.  Treatment of acute hyperammonemia is similar to the treatment of other urea cycle disorders, including initial protein restriction and provision of IV fluids, dextrose, arginine, benzoic acid and phenylacetate (Ammonul). If acute hyperammonemia does not respond to these interventions, hemodialysis may be needed. Long-term treatment includes a low protein diet supplemented with essential amino acids, citrulline and phenylbutyrate (an ammonia scavenger).  Ornithine translocase deficiency is a very rare disorder. More than 100 affected individuals have been described in the scientific literature. The most common mutation found in people with ornithine translocase deficiency deletes a phenylalanine at position 188 (Phe188del or F188del). This mutation is seen in 30 to 50 percent of affected individuals and most commonly occurs in the French-Canadian population. Another common mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with a premature stop signal  (Arg179Ter or R179X). This mutation is found in about 15 percent of affected individuals and most commonly occurs in Japanese and Middle Eastern populations.

This gene is located on chromosome 1p34. Allelic dominant conditions include GLUT1 deficiency syndrome with pseudohyperkalemia and hemolysis (also known as Stomatin-deficient cryohydrocytosis with neurologic defects), GLUT1 deficiency syndrome-2 , Dystonia-9, and Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy-12. The SLC2A1 gene encodes the glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1). The GLUT1 protein is embedded in the outer membrane surrounding cells, where it transports glucose into cells from the blood or from other cells for use as fuel. In the brain, the GLUT1 protein is involved in transporting glucose across the blood-brain barrier. The GLUT1 protein also transports glucose between glial cells.  GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is a disorder affecting the nervous system that can have a variety of neurological signs and symptoms and a variable phenotypic spectrum.  Approximately 90 percent of affected individuals have a form of the disorder often referred to as common GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. These individuals generally have epilepsy beginning in the first months of life. In newborns, the first sign of the disorder may be rapid and irregular involuntary eye movements. Babies with common GLUT1 deficiency syndrome  have a normal head size at birth, but growth of the brain and skull is often slow, which can result in microcephaly. Patients with this form of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome may have developmental delay or intellectual disability. Most affected individuals also have other neurological problems, including spasticity, ataxia, and speech dysarthria. Some experience episodes of confusion, lethargy, headaches, or myoclonus, particularly during periods of fasting. About 10 percent of individuals with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome have a form of the disorder often known as non-epileptic GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, which is usually less severe than the more common form of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. Most of these patients have ataxia or dystonia which may be quite pronounced. People with the non-epileptic form do not have seizures, but they may still have developmental delay and intellectual disability. Several conditions that were originally given other names have since been recognized to be variants of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. In rare cases, people with variants of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome produce abnormal red blood cells and have uncommon forms of a blood condition known as anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells.  GLUT1 deficiency syndrome-1 represents the more severe end of the phenotypic spectrum. Correct diagnosis of GLUT1 deficiency is important because treatment with a ketogenic diet often results in marked clinical improvement in motor and seizure symptoms.

", "Wilms tumor is a form of kidney cancer that primarily develops in children. Nearly all cases of Wilms tumor are diagnosed before the age of 10, with two-thirds being found before age 5.Wilms tumor is often first noticed because of abdominal swelling or a mass in the kidney that can be felt upon physical examination. Some affected children have abdominal pain, fever, a low number of red blood cells (anemia), blood in the urine (hematuria), or high blood pressure (hypertension). Additional signs of Wilms tumor can include loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness (lethargy).Wilms tumor can develop in one or both kidneys. About 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals develop multiple tumors in one or both kidneys. Wilms tumor may spread from the kidneys to other parts of the body (metastasize). In rare cases, Wilms tumor does not involve the kidneys and occurs instead in the genital tract, bladder, abdomen, chest, or lower back. It is unclear how Wilms tumor develops in these tissues.With proper treatment, children with Wilms tumor have a 90 percent survival rate.

Although Fanconi Anemia (FA) can be caused by pathogenic variants in a number of genes, Complementation Group D1 Fanconi Anemia is an autosomal recessive condition caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Carriers of germline mutations in BRCA2 are known to be at an increased risk of developing Wilms tumor, breast/ovarian cancer or medulloblastoma, as well as other cancers but do not have Fanconi Anemia.  The BRCA2 gene is located on chromosome 13q13. The BRCA2 gene product acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. The BRCA2 protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA. It interacts with several other proteins to mend breaks in DNA. These breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, and they also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division. By helping to repair DNA, the BRCA2 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information. The cellular hallmark of FA is hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and high frequency of chromosomal aberrations pointing to a defect in DNA repair.  The first signs of FA are typically non-hematological features. Unilateral or asymmetric bilateral limb anomalies, typically affecting the extremities, are common. Other minor anomalies may include low birth length and weight, microcephaly and/or microphthalmia. Skin pigmentation abnormalities (caf\u00e9-au-lait macules) and hypoplastic thenar eminence are frequent. Up to 20% of patients have ear malformations with or without hearing loss. Congenital malformations may involve other organ systems. There is variability of clinical findings within families. Short stature is syndromic but may also be associated with an underlying endocrinopathy. Fertility is frequently impaired in males, and is highly disturbed in half of females. When congenital malformations are not prominent, diagnosis may be delayed until the onset of hematological anomalies. Bone marrow failure occurs at a median age of 7 years, developing in 90% of patients by 40 years of age.  Early hematologic manifestations include macrocytosis and thrombocytopenia. In general, individuals with FA are highly predisposed to solid tumors (most frequently head and neck or anogenital regions). Patients with biallelic BRCA2 mutations generally display a more severe phenotype, with earlier onset and increased incidence of leukemia and other solid tumors, than other patients with FA. Mutations in BRCA2 are associated with a very high risk of solid tumors in infancy and early childhood. The cumulative incidence of cancer in FA caused by mutations in BRCA2 is 97% by age 7 years.  The only curative treatment for hematologic manifestations of FA is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Symptomatic treatment includes oral androgen administration, which improves blood counts in most patients but can be associated with severe liver toxicity and does not suppress the leukemic risk. Administration of G-CSF, best after bone marrow aspirate, should be considered in patients with acute severe infections. HSCT efficiently treats bone marrow failure. Solid tumors prevention and treatment are the main challenge for transplanted patients. Regular screening for hematological malignancies is recommended during childhood in non-transplanted patients; with the exception of 1q anomalies, identification of a clonal event should lead to transplantation. Screening for solid tumors should start in adolescence, especially in the post-transplant setting; risk may be higher in patients with chronic graft versus host disease. Any suspect lesion should be biopsied. When malignancies develop, treatment is complicated by the sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy of FA patients.  The expected prevalence of FA at birth is at least 1/160,000. Around 3-5% of cases are caused by biallelic mutations in the BRCA2 gene.

The SMN1 gene provides instructions for making the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The SMN protein is found throughout the body, with highest levels in the spinal cord. This protein is one of a group of proteins called the SMN complex, which is important for the maintenance motor neurons. These cells are located in the spinal cord and the brainstem. Motor neurons transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord necessary for muscle contraction, which allows the body to move.  Many mutations in the SMN1 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy. This condition is characterized by a loss of motor neurons that leads to weakness and wasting (atrophy) in skeletal muscles that worsens with age. Spinal muscular atrophy has a wide range of severity. There are many types of spinal muscular atrophy that differ in age of onset and level of muscle functioning (see below); however, there is overlap among the types. About 95 percent of individuals with spinal muscular atrophy have mutations that delete a piece of the SMN1 gene in both copies of the gene in each cell. As a result, SMN protein production is impaired. In about 5 percent of people with this disorder, one copy of the SMN1 gene is missing a section, and the other copy has a different kind of mutation that disrupts the production or function of the SMN protein.  Researchers suggest that a shortage of SMN protein leads to the inefficient assembly of the machinery needed to process pre-mRNA. A lack of mature mRNA, and subsequently the proteins needed for normal cell functioning, has damaging effects on motor neuron development and survival. The loss of motor neurons leads to the signs and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy. However, it is unclear why these cells are particularly sensitive to a reduction in the amount of SMN protein. Some research findings indicate that a shortage of this protein impairs the formation and function of axons and dendrites, leading to the death of motor neurons.  Typically, people have two copies of the SMN1 gene and one to two copies of a similar gene, SMN2,  in each cell. Several different versions of the SMN protein are produced from the SMN2 gene, but only one version (called isoform d) is full size and functional. The other versions are smaller and quickly broken down. The full-size protein made from the SMN2 gene is identical to the protein made by SMN1; however, only 10 to 15 percent of all functional SMN protein is produced from the SMN2 gene (the rest is produced from the SMN1 gene). The number of copies of the SMN2 gene varies, with some people having up to eight copies. The more SMN2 gene copies a person has, the more SMN protein they produce. Multiple copies of the SMN2 gene are usually associated with less severe features of spinal muscular atrophy that develop later in life. The small amount of SMN protein produced by the SMN2 genes can help make up for the protein deficiency caused by SMN1 gene mutations. Other factors, many unknown, also contribute to the variable severity of spinal muscular atrophy.  Spinal muscular atrophy is characterized by weakness and wasting (atrophy) in skeletal muscles. It is caused by a loss of motor neurons. The weakness tends to be more severe in proximal muscles. The muscle weakness usually worsens with age. There are many types of spinal muscular atrophy that are caused by changes in the same genes. The types differ in age of onset and severity of muscle weakness; however, there is overlap between the types. Spinal muscular atrophy type 0 is evident before birth and is the rarest and most severe form of the condition. Affected infants move less in the womb, and as a result they are often born with contractures. They have extremely weak muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth. Their respiratory muscles are very weak and they often do not survive past infancy due to respiratory failure. Some infants with spinal muscular atrophy type 0 also have congenital heart defects. Spinal muscular atrophy type I (also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) is the most common form of the condition. It is a severe form of the disorder with muscle weakness evident at birth or within the first few months of life. Most affected children cannot control their head movements or sit unassisted. Children with this type may have swallowing problems that can lead to difficulty feeding and poor growth. They can also have breathing problems due to weakness of respiratory muscles and an abnormally bell-shaped chest that prevents the lungs from fully expanding. Most children with spinal muscular atrophy type I do not survive past early childhood due to respiratory failure. Spinal muscular atrophy type II (also called Dubowitz disease) is characterized by muscle weakness that develops in children between ages 6 and 12 months. Children with this type can sit without support, although they may need help getting to a seated position. However, as the muscle weakness worsens later in childhood, affected individuals may need support to sit. Individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type II cannot stand or walk unaided. They often have tremors in their fingers, scoliosis, and respiratory muscle weakness that can be life-threatening. The life span of individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type II varies, but many people with this condition live into their twenties or thirties. Spinal muscular atrophy type III (also called Kugelberg-Welander disease) typically causes muscle weakness after early childhood. Individuals with this condition can stand and walk unaided, but over time, walking and climbing stairs may become increasingly difficult. Many affected individuals require wheelchair assistance later in life. People with spinal muscular atrophy type III typically have a normal life expectancy. Spinal muscular atrophy type IV is rare and often begins in early adulthood. Affected individuals usually experience mild to moderate muscle weakness, tremors, and mild breathing problems. People with spinal muscular atrophy type IV have a normal life expectancy.  There is no cure for SMA. Treatment consists of managing the symptoms and preventing complications. In the past, treatment was supportive: physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation to improve posture, prevent joint immobility, and slow muscle weakness and atrophy;   stretching and strengthening exercises to reduce spasticity, increase range of motion, and keep circulation flowing; speech therapy for speech, chewing, and swallowing difficulties.  Assistive devices such as supports or braces, orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs may help some people retain independence. Proper nutrition and a balanced diet are essential to maintaining weight and strength. Non-invasive ventilation at night can prevent apnea in sleep, and some individuals may also require assisted ventilation due to muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest during daytime.  A number of new pharmacologic interventions have been developed or are under development. The FDA has approved several drugs for treatment:    Nusinersen (Spinraza \u2122), used to  treat children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy,  is designed to increase production of the full-length SMN protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons.   Onasemnogene abeparovec-xioi (Zolgensma \u2122) is a gene therapy for children less than 2 years old who have infantile-onset SMA.  A safe virus delivers a fully functional human SMN gene to the targeted motor neurons, which in turn improves muscle movement and function, and also improves survival.  Risdiplam (Evrysdi), an orally-administered drug that acts as an SMN2 splicing modifier, is used to treat patients age two months of age and older with SMA.  Spinal muscular atrophy affects 1 per 8,000 to 10,000 people worldwide. Spinal muscular atrophy type I is the most common type, accounting for about half of all cases. Types II and III are the next most common and types 0 and IV are rare.  ", "Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by weakness and wasting (atrophy) in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). It is caused by a loss of specialized nerve cells, called motor neurons that control muscle movement. The weakness tends to be more severe in the muscles that are close to the center of the body (proximal) compared to muscles away from the body's center (distal). The muscle weakness usually worsens with age. There are many types of spinal muscular atrophy that are caused by changes in the same genes. The types differ in age of onset and severity of muscle weakness; however, there is overlap between the types. Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy and related motor neuron diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy, spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance, X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 are caused by mutations in other genes.Spinal muscular atrophy type 0 is evident before birth and is the rarest and most severe form of the condition. Affected infants move less in the womb, and as a result they are often born with joint deformities (contractures). They have extremely weak muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth.

It is caused by a loss of motor neurons. The weakness tends to be more severe in proximal muscles. The muscle weakness usually worsens with age. There are many types of spinal muscular atrophy that are caused by changes in the same genes. The types differ in age of onset and severity of muscle weakness; however, there is overlap between the types. Spinal muscular atrophy type 0 is evident before birth and is the rarest and most severe form of the condition. Affected infants move less in the womb, and as a result they are often born with contractures. They have extremely weak muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth. Their respiratory muscles are very weak and they often do not survive past infancy due to respiratory failure. Some infants with spinal muscular atrophy type 0 also have congenital heart defects. Spinal muscular atrophy type I (also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) is the most common form of the condition. It is a severe form of the disorder with muscle weakness evident at birth or within the first few months of life. Most affected children cannot control their head movements or sit unassisted. Children with this type may have swallowing problems that can lead to difficulty feeding and poor growth. They can also have breathing problems due to weakness of respiratory muscles and an abnormally bell-shaped chest that prevents the lungs from fully expanding. Most children with spinal muscular atrophy type I do not survive past early childhood due to respiratory failure. Spinal muscular atrophy type II (also called Dubowitz disease) is characterized by muscle weakness that develops in children between ages 6 and 12 months. Children with this type can sit without support, although they may need help getting to a seated position. However, as the muscle weakness worsens later in childhood, affected individuals may need support to sit. Individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type II cannot stand or walk unaided. They often have tremors in their fingers, scoliosis, and respiratory muscle weakness that can be life-threatening. The life span of individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type II varies, but many people with this condition live into their twenties or thirties. Spinal muscular atrophy type III (also called Kugelberg-Welander disease) typically causes muscle weakness after early childhood. Individuals with this condition can stand and walk unaided, but over time, walking and climbing stairs may become increasingly difficult. Many affected individuals require wheelchair assistance later in life. People with spinal muscular atrophy type III typically have a normal life expectancy. Spinal muscular atrophy type IV is rare and often begins in early adulthood. Affected individuals usually experience mild to moderate muscle weakness, tremors, and mild breathing problems. People with spinal muscular atrophy type IV have a normal life expectancy.  There is no cure for SMA. Treatment consists of managing the symptoms and preventing complications. In the past, treatment was supportive: physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation to improve posture, prevent joint immobility, and slow muscle weakness and atrophy;   stretching and strengthening exercises to reduce spasticity, increase range of motion, and keep circulation flowing; speech therapy for speech, chewing, and swallowing difficulties.  Assistive devices such as supports or braces, orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs may help some people retain independence. Proper nutrition and a balanced diet are essential to maintaining weight and strength. Non-invasive ventilation at night can prevent apnea in sleep, and some individuals may also require assisted ventilation due to muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest during daytime.  A number of new pharmacologic interventions have been developed or are under development. The FDA has approved several drugs for treatment:    Nusinersen (Spinraza \u2122), used to  treat children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy,  is designed to increase production of the full-length SMN protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons.   Onasemnogene abeparovec-xioi (Zolgensma \u2122) is a gene therapy for children less than 2 years old who have infantile-onset SMA.  A safe virus delivers a fully functional human SMN gene to the targeted motor neurons, which in turn improves muscle movement and function, and also improves survival.  Risdiplam (Evrysdi), an orally-administered drug that acts as an SMN2 splicing modifier, is used to treat patients age two months of age and older with SMA.  ", "Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by weakness and wasting (atrophy) in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). It is caused by a loss of specialized nerve cells, called motor neurons that control muscle movement. The weakness tends to be more severe in the muscles that are close to the center of the body (proximal) compared to muscles away from the body's center (distal). The muscle weakness usually worsens with age. There are many types of spinal muscular atrophy that are caused by changes in the same genes. The types differ in age of onset and severity of muscle weakness; however, there is overlap between the types. Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy and related motor neuron diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy, spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance, X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 are caused by mutations in other genes.Spinal muscular atrophy type 0 is evident before birth and is the rarest and most severe form of the condition. Affected infants move less in the womb, and as a result they are often born with joint deformities (contractures). They have extremely weak muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth.

Types II and III are the next most common and types 0 and IV are rare.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive condition caused by changes in the SMN1 gene.  The SMN1 gene provides instructions for making the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The SMN protein is found throughout the body, with highest levels in the spinal cord. This protein is one of a group of proteins called the SMN complex, which is important for the maintenance motor neurons. These cells are located in the spinal cord and the brainstem. Motor neurons transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord necessary for muscle contraction, which allows the body to move.  Many mutations in the SMN1 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy. This condition is characterized by a loss of motor neurons that leads to weakness and wasting (atrophy) in skeletal muscles that worsens with age. Spinal muscular atrophy has a wide range of severity. There are many types of spinal muscular atrophy that differ in age of onset and level of muscle functioning (see below); however, there is overlap among the types. About 95 percent of individuals with spinal muscular atrophy have mutations that delete a piece of the SMN1 gene in both copies of the gene in each cell. As a result, SMN protein production is impaired. In about 5 percent of people with this disorder, one copy of the SMN1 gene is missing a section, and the other copy has a different kind of mutation that disrupts the production or function of the SMN protein.  Researchers suggest that a shortage of SMN protein leads to the inefficient assembly of the machinery needed to process pre-mRNA. A lack of mature mRNA, and subsequently the proteins needed for normal cell functioning, has damaging effects on motor neuron development and survival. The loss of motor neurons leads to the signs and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy. However, it is unclear why these cells are particularly sensitive to a reduction in the amount of SMN protein. Some research findings indicate that a shortage of this protein impairs the formation and function of axons and dendrites, leading to the death of motor neurons.  Typically, people have two copies of the SMN1 gene and one to two copies of a similar gene, SMN2,  in each cell. Several different versions of the SMN protein are produced from the SMN2 gene, but only one version (called isoform d) is full size and functional. The other versions are smaller and quickly broken down. The full-size protein made from the SMN2 gene is identical to the protein made by SMN1; however, only 10 to 15 percent of all functional SMN protein is produced from the SMN2 gene (the rest is produced from the SMN1 gene). The number of copies of the SMN2 gene varies, with some people having up to eight copies. The more SMN2 gene copies a person has, the more SMN protein they produce. Multiple copies of the SMN2 gene are usually associated with less severe features of spinal muscular atrophy that develop later in life. The small amount of SMN protein produced by the SMN2 genes can help make up for the protein deficiency caused by SMN1 gene mutations.

The proteins play a role in the regulation of intracellular protein transport between donor and target membranes. This docking and fusion process requires the interaction of specific vesicle-SNARES with specific cognate target SNAREs.   Familial Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  is a rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by a macrophage activation syndrome with an onset usually occurring within a few months or, less commonly several years,  after birth. Symptoms usually become apparent when the immune system launches an exaggerated response to an infection although it may occur in the absence of infection.  The condition is described as a hyperinflammatory disorder resulting from excessive activation of lymphocytes (T cells, natural killer cells, B cell and macrophages-also known as histiocytes). Clinically, it requires 5 of 8 criteria for diagnosis. These criteria include fever, splenomegaly, bicytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis, low or absent natural killer cell activity, hyperferritinemia and high soluble IL2 receptor levels. Persistent remission is rarely achieved with chemo- or immunotherapy. Without treatment, most people with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis survive only a few months. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only cure.

", "Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a disorder in which the immune system produces too many activated immune cells (lymphocytes) called T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and macrophages (histiocytes). Excessive amounts of immune system proteins called cytokines are also produced. This overactivation of the immune system causes fever and damages the liver and spleen, resulting in enlargement of these organs.Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, a process called hemophagocytosis. As a result, affected individuals have low numbers of red blood cells (anemia) and a reduction in the number of platelets, which are involved in clotting. A reduction in platelets may cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.The brain may also be affected in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. As a result, affected individuals may experience irritability, delayed closure of the bones of the skull in infants, neck stiffness, abnormal muscle tone, impaired muscle coordination, paralysis, blindness, seizures, and coma. In addition to neurological problems, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can cause abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemia and lymphoma).Signs and symptoms of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis usually become apparent during infancy, although occasionally they appear later in life.

Other clinical findings may include sensorineural hearing loss and hypogammaglobulinemia. Without treatment, most people with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis survive only a few months.   Persistent remission is rarely achieved with chemo- or immunotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only cure but, as noted previously, does not cure the associated enteropathy.  Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide.The prevalence and incidence of cases caused by variants in STXBP2 is not known, although it has been reported that mutations in STXBP2 may account for 10% of cases of FHL (PMID 31651895) .  ", "Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a disorder in which the immune system produces too many activated immune cells (lymphocytes) called T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and macrophages (histiocytes). Excessive amounts of immune system proteins called cytokines are also produced. This overactivation of the immune system causes fever and damages the liver and spleen, resulting in enlargement of these organs.Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, a process called hemophagocytosis. As a result, affected individuals have low numbers of red blood cells (anemia) and a reduction in the number of platelets, which are involved in clotting. A reduction in platelets may cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.The brain may also be affected in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. As a result, affected individuals may experience irritability, delayed closure of the bones of the skull in infants, neck stiffness, abnormal muscle tone, impaired muscle coordination, paralysis, blindness, seizures, and coma. In addition to neurological problems, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can cause abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing cancers of blood-forming cells (leukemia and lymphoma).Signs and symptoms of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis usually become apparent during infancy, although occasionally they appear later in life. They usually occur when the immune system launches an exaggerated response to an infection, but may also occur in the absence of infection.

Barth syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males.In males with Barth syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy is often present at birth or develops within the first months of life. Over time, the heart muscle becomes increasingly weakened and is less able to pump blood. Individuals with Barth syndrome may have elastic fibers in place of muscle fibers in some areas of the heart muscle, which contributes to the cardiomyopathy. This condition is called endocardial fibroelastosis; it results in thickening of the muscle and impairs its ability to pump blood. In people with Barth syndrome, the heart problems can lead to heart failure. In rare cases, the cardiomyopathy gets better over time and affected individuals eventually have no symptoms of heart disease.In Barth syndrome, skeletal myopathy, particularly of the muscles closest to the center of the body (proximal muscles), is usually noticeable from birth and causes low muscle tone (hypotonia). The muscle weakness often causes delay of motor skills such as crawling and walking. Additionally, affected individuals tend to experience extreme tiredness (fatigue) during strenuous physical activity.Most males with Barth syndrome have neutropenia. The levels of white blood cells can be consistently low (persistent), can vary from normal to low (intermittent), or can cycle between regular episodes of normal and low (cyclical). Neutropenia makes it more difficult for the body to fight off foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses, so affected individuals have an increased risk of recurrent infections.Newborns with Barth syndrome are often smaller than normal, and their growth continues to be slow throughout life. Some boys with this condition experience a growth spurt in puberty and are of average height as adults, but many men with Barth syndrome continue to have short stature in adulthood.Males with Barth syndrome often have distinctive facial features including prominent cheeks. Affected individuals typically have normal intelligence but often have difficulty performing tasks involving math or visual-spatial skills such as puzzles.Males with Barth syndrome have increased levels of a substance called 3-methylglutaconic acid in their blood and urine. The amount of the acid does not appear to influence the signs and symptoms of the condition. Barth syndrome is one of a group of metabolic disorders that can be diagnosed by the presence of increased levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in urine (3-methylglutaconic aciduria).Even though most features of Barth syndrome are present at birth or in infancy, affected individuals may not experience health problems until later in life. The age at which individuals with Barth syndrome display symptoms or are diagnosed varies greatly. The severity of signs and symptoms among affected individuals is also highly variable.Males with Barth syndrome have a reduced life expectancy.

These forms of diabetes typically begin before age 30, although they can occur later in life. In MODY, elevated blood sugar arises from reduced production of insulin, which is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Specifically, insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells, where it is used as an energy source.The different types of MODY are distinguished by their genetic causes. The most common types are HNF1A-MODY (also known as MODY3), accounting for 50 to 70 percent of cases, and GCK-MODY (MODY2), accounting for 30 to 50 percent of cases. Less frequent types include HNF4A-MODY (MODY1) and renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome (also known as HNF1B-MODY or MODY5), which each account for 5 to 10 percent of cases. At least ten other types have been identified, and these are very rare.HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY have similar signs and symptoms that develop slowly over time. Early signs and symptoms in these types are caused by high blood sugar and may include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, weight loss, and recurrent skin infections. Over time uncontrolled high blood sugar can damage small blood vessels in the eyes and kidneys. Damage to the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) causes a condition known as diabetic retinopathy that can lead to vision loss and eventual blindness. Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While these two types of MODY are very similar, certain features are particular to each type. For example, babies with HNF4A-MODY tend to weigh more than average or have abnormally low blood sugar at birth, even though other signs of the condition do not occur until childhood or young adulthood. People with HNF1A-MODY have a higher-than-average risk of developing noncancerous (benign) liver tumors known as hepatocellular adenomas.GCK-MODY is a very mild type of the condition. People with this type have slightly elevated blood sugar levels, particularly in the morning before eating (fasting blood sugar).

In addition to being linked to this condition, variants in HNF1A have also been shown to result in several other dominantly inherited phenotypes, including Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus 20 and Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young, Type 3.  The HNF1A gene provides instructions for making hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1\u03b1), a transcription factor that seems to be especially important in the pancreas and liver. It is critical for the growth and development of pancreatic beta cells and thus, in production and secretion of insulin. It is also thought to act as a tumor suppressor, particularly in the liver. HNF-1\u03b1 includes a dimerization domain that is critical for protein- protein interactions, including interactions with other HNF-1\u03b1 proteins or with proteins with a similar structure, to create dimers that function as transcription factors. It also has a DNA binding domain important for DNA binding and transcription regulation.  Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin resulting in frequent hypoglycemic episodes. In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by lethargy, irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.   The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods of fasting or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in individuals with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating. Notably, the clinical course may evolve  into maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) later in life.  Therapeutically, HNF1A mutations are responsive to diazoxide. In some patients the clinical phenotype is so mild that they may not need medical therapy and are stable with frequent feeding. If diazoxide treatment is necessary, hydrochlorothiazide is typically used as well to prevent fluid retention.  Congenital hyperinsulinism affects approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns. This condition is more common in certain populations, affecting up to 1 in 2,500 newborns . Most cases of congenital hyperinsulinism are caused by variants in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11; mutations in HNF1A account for only a small percentage of cases.

The THBD gene encodes thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin is an endothelial cell surface glycoprotein that forms a complex with the coagulation factor thrombin. Binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin alters its specificity toward several substrates resulting in its activity as an antithrombotic factor. Mutations in THBD have been linked to susceptibility to development of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome characterized by 1 or more episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with acute renal failure. Age of onset is variable ranging from childhood to young adulthood. Recurrence has been reported. Plasma exchange therapy, while effective, has, for the most part been superseded by treatment with eculizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the complement protein C5. Eculizumab specifically binds with high affinity to the complement protein C5, inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. By inhibiting the complement cascade at this point, the normal, disease-preventing functions of the proximal complement system are largely preserved, while the properties of C5 that promote inflammation and cell destruction are impeded. Eculizumab carries a black box warning for the risk of meningococcal infections and can only be prescribed by doctors who have enrolled in and follow a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy required by the FDA. Due to the increased risk of meningococcal infections, meningococcal vaccination is recommended at least 2 weeks prior to receiving eculizumab, unless the risks of delaying eculizumab therapy outweigh the risk of developing a meningococcal infection, in which case the meningococcal vaccine should be administered as soon as possible. It is also recommended that patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin followed by penicillin V or erythromycin if penicillin-allergic) as soon as they start eculizumab and should remain on them as long as they are taking eculizumab.  Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down prematurely. In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. Thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cells that normally assist with blood clotting. In people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream because a large number of platelets are used to make abnormal clots. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases. These life-threatening complications prevent the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The two disorders have different causes and different signs and symptoms. Unlike the atypical form, the typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce toxic substances called Shiga-like toxins. The typical form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger than 10. The typical form is less likely than the atypical form to involve recurrent attacks of kidney damage that lead to ESRD.  The exact overall incidence and prevalence of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is unknown. One study placed the incidence in the United States at 2 individuals per 1 million in the general population. In Europe, the disorder is estimated to affect approximately .11 per 1 million individuals between the ages of 0-18. aHUS accounts for approximately 5-10% of all cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome.

This protein plays an important role in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. During bone remodeling, RANK helps direct the formation and function of specialized cells called osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue. RANK is located on the surface of immature osteoclasts, where it receives signals that trigger these cells to mature and become fully functional. Variants in this gene are responsible for several rare bone disorders, including familial expansile osteolysis, expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia (ESH) and early onset Paget disease of bone 2. Like early-onset Paget disease of bone, FEO and ESH result from duplication mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene. Studies suggest that these mutations overactivate RANK, leading it to stimulate the production of too many osteoclasts and trigger these cells to break down bone abnormally. The resulting imbalance in bone remodeling causes the major features of these disorders. It is unclear why duplication mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene can cause several different bone diseases. Onset of FEO is variable, ranging for childhood through adulthood and is characterized by elevated alkaline phosphatase levels,  bone pain, deformity, pathological fractures, early/progressive conductive hearing loss, and dental abnormalities. Focal bone lesions are typically found in the appendicular skeleton and consist of progressively expanding lytic areas, while generalized disordered bone modeling and altered trabecular pattern are the result of the multifocal, progressive nature of the disease.

Any bones can be affected, although the disease most commonly affects bones in the spine, pelvis, skull, or legs.Many people with classic Paget disease of bone do not experience any symptoms associated with their bone abnormalities. The disease is often diagnosed unexpectedly by x-rays or laboratory tests done for other reasons. People who develop symptoms are most likely to experience pain.

Mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene appear to be a very rare cause of ARO; fewer than 10 mutations have been found in affected individuals. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the RANK protein, which prevents it from receiving signals on the surface of immature osteoclasts. As a result, people with this condition have a total absence of mature, functional osteoclasts.

Dense bones can also impair the function of bone marrow, preventing it from producing new blood cells and immune system cells. As a result, people with severe osteopetrosis are at risk of abnormal bleeding, a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), and recurrent infections. In the most severe cases, these bone marrow abnormalities can be life-threatening in infancy or early childhood.  Patients with this rare form of osteopetrosis can be treated with by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Researchers have described several major types of osteopetrosis, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. The different types of the disorder can also be distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms.Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO), which is also called Albers-Sch\u00f6nberg disease, is typically the mildest type of the disorder. Some affected individuals have no symptoms. In these people, the unusually dense bones may be discovered by accident when an x-ray is done for another reason. In affected individuals who develop signs and symptoms, the major features of the condition include multiple bone fractures, abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) or other spinal abnormalities, arthritis in the hips, and a bone infection called osteomyelitis. These problems usually become apparent in late childhood or adolescence.Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) is a more severe form of the disorder that becomes apparent in early infancy.

As a result, people with severe osteopetrosis are at risk of abnormal bleeding, a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), and recurrent infections. In the most severe cases, these bone marrow abnormalities can be life-threatening in infancy or early childhood.Other features of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis can include slow growth and short stature, dental abnormalities, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Depending on the genetic changes involved, people with severe osteopetrosis can also have brain abnormalities, intellectual disability, or recurrent seizures (epilepsy).A few individuals have been diagnosed with intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis (IAO), a form of the disorder that can have either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The signs and symptoms of this condition become noticeable in childhood and include an increased risk of bone fracture and anemia. People with this form of the disorder typically do not have life-threatening bone marrow abnormalities. However, some affected individuals have had abnormal calcium deposits (calcifications) in the brain, intellectual disability, and a form of kidney disease called renal tubular acidosis.Rarely, osteopetrosis can have an X-linked pattern of inheritance. In addition to abnormally dense bones, the X-linked form of the disorder is characterized by abnormal swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema) and a condition called anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia that affects the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. Affected individuals also have a malfunctioning immune system (immunodeficiency), which allows severe, recurrent infections to develop.

Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Most of the autoimmune disorders associated with ALPS target and damage blood cells. For example, the immune system may attack red blood cells (autoimmune hemolytic anemia), white blood cells (autoimmune neutropenia), or platelets  (autoimmune thrombocytopenia).

The TSC1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called hamartin, whose function is not fully understood. Within cells, hamartin interacts with a protein called tuberin, which is produced from the TSC2 gene. These two proteins help control cell growth and size. Proteins that normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way are known as tumor suppressors. Hamartin and tuberin carry out their tumor suppressor function by interacting with and regulating a wide variety of other proteins. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 cause a condition known as tuberous sclerosis complex.  Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous  benign tumors in many parts of the body. These tumors can occur in the skin, brain, kidneys, and other organs, in some cases leading to significant health problems. Tuberous sclerosis complex also causes developmental problems, and the signs and symptoms of the condition vary from person to person. Virtually all affected people have skin abnormalities, including patches of unusually light-colored skin (ash-leaf spots), areas of raised and thickened skin (shagreen patches), and growths under the nails (periungual or subungual fibromas). Tumors on the face called facial angiofibromas are also common beginning in childhood. Tuberous sclerosis complex often affects the brain, resulting in a pattern of behaviors called TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND). These disorders include hyperactivity, aggression, psychiatric conditions, intellectual disability, and problems with communication and social interaction (autism spectrum disorder). Some individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex have seizures or benign brain tumors that can cause serious or life-threatening complications. Kidney tumors are common in people with tuberous sclerosis complex; these growths can cause severe problems with kidney function and may be life-threatening in some cases. Additionally, tumors can develop in the heart and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Some women with tuberous sclerosis complex develop lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), which is a lung disease characterized by the abnormal overgrowth of smooth muscle-like tissue in the lungs that cause coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and lung collapse.  People with tuberous sclerosis complex are born with one mutated copy of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene in each cell. This mutation prevents the cell from making functional hamartin or tuberin from the altered copy of the gene. However, enough protein is usually produced from the other, normal copy of the gene to regulate cell growth effectively. For some types of tumors to develop, a second mutation involving the other copy of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene must occur in certain cells during a person's lifetime. When both copies of the TSC1 gene are mutated in a particular cell, that cell cannot produce any functional hamartin; cells with two altered copies of the TSC2 gene are unable to produce any functional tuberin. The loss of these proteins allows the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a tumor. In people with tuberous sclerosis complex, a second TSC1 or TSC2 mutation typically occurs in multiple cells over an affected person's lifetime. The loss of hamartin or tuberin in different types of cells leads to the growth of tumors in many different organs and tissues.  There is no cure for TSC, although treatment is available for a number of the symptoms. Antiepileptic drugs may be used to control seizures. Vigabatrin is a particularly useful medication in TSC and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of infantile spasms in TSC, although it has significant side effects. The FDA has approved the drug everolimus (Afinitor\u00ae) to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA brain tumors) and angiomyolipoma kidney tumors, in addition to intractable seizures. Specific medications may be prescribed for behavior problems. Intervention programs including special school programs and various therapies (such as physical, occupational, and speech therapies) may benefit individuals with special needs and developmental issues. Surgery may be needed in case of complications connected to tubers, subependymal nodules, or SEGA, as well as in risk of hemorrhage from kidney tumors. Respiratory insufficiency due to LAM can be treated with supplemental oxygen therapy or lung transplantation, if severe. Because TSC is a lifelong condition, individuals need to be regularly monitored by a doctor to make sure they are receiving the best possible treatments. Due to the many varied symptoms of TSC, care by a clinician experienced with the disorder is recommended.  Tuberous sclerosis complex affects about 1 in 6,000 people. Two thirds of affected individuals have TSC as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. TSC1 pathogenic variants produce a less severe phenotype than TSC2 pathogenic variants. A higher percentage of individuals with more severe features of TSC have a de novo TSC2 pathogenic variant versus a de novo TSC1 pathogenic variant.

The TSC2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called tuberin, whose function is not fully understood. Within cells, tuberin interacts with a protein called hamartin, which is produced from the TSC1 gene. These two proteins help control cell growth and size. Proteins that normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way are known as tumor suppressors. Hamartin and tuberin carry out their tumor suppressor function by interacting with and regulating a wide variety of other proteins. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 cause a condition known as tuberous sclerosis complex.  Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous  benign tumors in many parts of the body. These tumors can occur in the skin, brain, kidneys, and other organs, in some cases leading to significant health problems. Tuberous sclerosis complex also causes developmental problems, and the signs and symptoms of the condition vary from person to person. Virtually all affected people have skin abnormalities, including patches of unusually light-colored skin (ash-leaf spots), areas of raised and thickened skin (shagreen patches), and growths under the nails (periungual or subungual fibromas). Tumors on the face called facial angiofibromas are also common beginning in childhood. Tuberous sclerosis complex often affects the brain, resulting in a pattern of behaviors called TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND). These disorders include hyperactivity, aggression, psychiatric conditions, intellectual disability, and problems with communication and social interaction (autism spectrum disorder). Some individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex have seizures or benign brain tumors that can cause serious or life-threatening complications. Kidney tumors are common in people with tuberous sclerosis complex; these growths can cause severe problems with kidney function and may be life-threatening in some cases. Additionally, tumors can develop in the heart and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Some women with tuberous sclerosis complex develop lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), which is a lung disease characterized by the abnormal overgrowth of smooth muscle-like tissue in the lungs that cause coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and lung collapse.  People with tuberous sclerosis complex are born with one mutated copy of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene in each cell. This mutation prevents the cell from making functional hamartin or tuberin from the altered copy of the gene. However, enough protein is usually produced from the other, normal copy of the gene to regulate cell growth effectively. For some types of tumors to develop, a second mutation involving the other copy of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene must occur in certain cells during a person's lifetime. When both copies of the TSC1 gene are mutated in a particular cell, that cell cannot produce any functional hamartin; cells with two altered copies of the TSC2 gene are unable to produce any functional tuberin. The loss of these proteins allows the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a tumor. In people with tuberous sclerosis complex, a second TSC1 or TSC2 mutation typically occurs in multiple cells over an affected person's lifetime. The loss of hamartin or tuberin in different types of cells leads to the growth of tumors in many different organs and tissues.  There is no cure for TSC, although treatment is available for a number of the symptoms. Antiepileptic drugs may be used to control seizures. Vigabatrin is a particularly useful medication in TSC and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of infantile spasms in TSC, although it has significant side effects. The FDA has approved the drug everolimus (Afinitor\u00ae) to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA brain tumors) and angiomyolipoma kidney tumors, in addition to intractable seizures. Specific medications may be prescribed for behavior problems. Intervention programs including special school programs and various therapies (such as physical, occupational, and speech therapies) may benefit individuals with special needs and developmental issues. Surgery may be needed in case of complications connected to tubers, subependymal nodules, or SEGA, as well as in risk of hemorrhage from kidney tumors. Respiratory insufficiency due to LAM can be treated with supplemental oxygen therapy or lung transplantation, if severe. Because TSC is a lifelong condition, individuals need to be regularly monitored by a doctor to make sure they are receiving the best possible treatments. Due to the many varied symptoms of TSC, care by a clinician experienced with the disorder is recommended.  Tuberous sclerosis complex affects about 1 in 6,000 people. Two thirds of affected individuals have TSC as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. TSC2 pathogenic variants produce a more severe phenotype than TSC1 pathogenic variants. A higher percentage of individuals with more severe features of TSC have a de novo TSC2 pathogenic variant versus a de novo TSC1 pathogenic variant.

UCP2 encodes a mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) that is a member of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins. UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis and facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, along with reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. Tissue specificity occurs for the different UCPs and the exact methods of how UCPs transfer H+/OH- are not known. UCP2 is thought to play a role in nonshivering thermogenesis, obesity and diabetes.  Hyperinsulinism due to UCP2 deficiency (HIUCP2) is still considered to cause a form of diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism, although its role as a monogenic cause of hyperinsulinism has been disputed. HIUCP2 is characterized by hypoglycemic episodes from the neonatal period, a good clinical response to diazoxide and a probable transient nature of the disease with spontaneous resolution. Glucagon is used for acute management of hypoglycemia. Somatostatin analogs have also been used to manage hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia.  mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus) have been used as a short-term, last-resort therapy, if hypoglycemia is difficult to manage, until normoglycemia is achieved with other agents such as somatostatin analogs to avoid pancreatectomy. Further studies evaluating the use of sirolimus in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism are required.  Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin. People with this condition have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia. In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma. The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life.   Congenital hyperinsulinism affects approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns.

Interestingly, nude mice, a laboratory mouse model with thymic aplasia and absent fur development, have a spontaneous deletion of FOXN1 and have been used in the laboratory to gain insights into the immune system, leukemia, solid tumors, AIDS and other forms of immune deficiency.   FOXN1 encodes a transcription factor important in the regulation of the development of skin, hair, nails, and the immune system. The FOXN1 protein also plays a critical role in the formation of the thymus, which is required for functional T cell maturation.  Affected individuals have thymic aplasia. Without functional T cells, affected individuals develop repeated and persistent infections, including oral candidiasis, starting early in life. The infections result in slow growth and can be life-threatening; without effective treatment, most affected individuals live only into infancy or early childhood. This condition also affects hair and nail growth: affected infants have congenital alopecia (absent scalp hair, eyebrows, eyelashes) and dystrophic-appearing nails (malformed finger- and toenails with ridging,  pitting or abnormal curvature). Although two individuals have been described with central nervous system involvement, it is not clear that this is a consistent finding in the condition.  Early treatment is critical. Aggressive treatment of infections is necessary. Antimicrobial prophylaxis, including prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci, is an important treatment. All supportive blood products should be irradiated and CMV-negative. Patients with FOXN1 mutations do not respond particularly well to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and it is not curative; thymic transplantation offers a potential cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used, although it is complicated by significant morbidity and mortality. Although HSCT is not curative, it does allow for relatively rapid reconstitution of the immune system before other life-threatening complications develop. HSCT containing mature donor T-cells should only be offered to patients with an HLA-matched genoidentical sibling donor. HSCT treatment may be particularly important in situations where thymic transplantation is not readily available or in the context of pre-existing systemic viral infection, where rapid recovery of T-cell mediated immunity is required. Thymic transplantation, without the need for HLA-matching, provided that it is accessible in a timely manner and that rapid T-cell recovery is not required (reconstitution may take several months) may be a better alternative, especially if an HLA-matched sibling donor is not available for HCT. It may have superior outcomes, although evidence for either treatment remains sparse.  T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy is a rare disorder <1/1,000,000).

This is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by variants in the FOXN1 gene located on 17q11.2. A more severe immunodeficiency, T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy, is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the same gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The FOXN1 gene provides instructions for making a transcription factor that is important for development of skin, hair follicles, finger- and toenails and the immune system. It also plays a critical role in thymus development which is required for maturation of T-cells. It is suspected that the FOXN1 protein is also involved in the development of the central nervous system, although its role in this is less clear.  With the advent of expanded newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency, it has become clear that heterozygous loss of function FOXN1 gene variants are associated with low levels of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and T cell lymphopenia at birth and increased susceptibility to infections and persistent lymphopenia during infancy. This predominantly affects CD8+ T cells. Research in mouse model systems and humans with heterozygous FOXN1 loss of function mutations demonstrate that FOXN1 gene dosage is most critical during embryonic and early post-natal life:  FOXN1 haploinsufficiency causes low TRECs and T cell lymphopenia at birth that progressively improves with age. In some individuals, these immunological abnormalities have been associated with recurrent infections, which were particularly severe in a few. Unlike the severe form, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or thymic transplantation is not indicated.  Acute infections should be treated aggressively with appropriate antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal or antiviral) therapy. Careful clinical monitoring and adoption of preventive measures with antimicrobial prophylaxis, as indicated in babies with severe T cell lymphopenia at birth, is recommended.

The MRAP gene provides instructions for making melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP). This protein transports the melanocortin-2 receptor (the adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] receptor), from the interior of the cell to the cell surface. Specifically, the MRAP protein transports the ACTH receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to the cell membrane. The MRAP protein is also needed to activate the ACTH receptor. At the cell membrane, the activated ACTH receptor binds to ACTH, triggering the production of glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol, corticosterone). These hormones aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other functions in the body.  Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition that occurs when the adrenal glands, which are hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney, do not produce glucocorticoids. Adrenal insufficiency causes the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. These signs and symptoms often begin in infancy or early childhood. Most affected children first develop hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemic children can fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). If left untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, learning difficulties, and other neurological problems. Hypoglycemia that is left untreated for prolonged periods can lead to neurological damage and death. Other features of familial glucocorticoid deficiency can include recurrent infections and skin hyperpigmentation. There are multiple types of familial glucocorticoid deficiency, which are distinguished by their genetic cause. Glucocorticoid therapy is effective in the treatment of glucocorticoid deficiency.  ", "Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition that occurs when the adrenal glands, which are hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney, do not produce certain hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body.A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) causes the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. These signs and symptoms often begin in infancy or early childhood. Most affected children first develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). These hypoglycemic children can fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). If left untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, learning difficulties, and other neurological problems. Hypoglycemia that is left untreated for prolonged periods can lead to neurological damage and death. Other features of familial glucocorticoid deficiency can include recurrent infections and skin coloring darker than that of other family members (hyperpigmentation).There are multiple types of familial glucocorticoid deficiency, which are distinguished by their genetic cause."], "alternate_names": ["GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 2; GCCD2"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 1304.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "MRAP"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Assisted ventilation"}, {"int_description_2": "Epinephrine"}, {"int_description_3": "Corticotropin"}, {"int_description_4": "Dobutamine"}, {"int_description_5": "Dopamine", "timeframe_int5": "Hours", "age_use_int5": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int5": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug5": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug5": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_6": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"int_description_7": "Antibiotics"}, {"int_description_8": "Glucocorticoid therapy"}, {"int_description_9": "Steroid treatment", "timeframe_int9": "Hours", "age_use_int9": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int9": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug9": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug9": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_10": "Sodium bicarbonate"}, {"int_description_11": "Exchange transfusion"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "The genetics of familial glucocorticoid deficiency.", "pmid_1": 19500760.0, "pmid_date_1": 2009.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Best practice & research.

The atypical form is probably about 10 times less common than the typical form.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal dominant, Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Susceptibility to Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) 5 is an autosomal dominant susceptibility to developing atypical HUS, caused by variants in the C3 gene located on chromosome 19p13.3. The C3 gene provides instructions for making complement component 3 (C3), a protein that plays a key role in activating the complement system, an innate immune system consisting of a group of proteins that work together to destroy microbes, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. C3 is cleaved into two smaller fragments when the complement system is triggered by an invading microoganism. One of these fragments, C3b interacts with cell surface proteins to trigger the complement system response, which must be carefully regulated so that the system does not damage healthy cells. Mutations in C3 have been linked to susceptibility to development of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome characterized by one or more episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with acute renal failure. Reported age at onset of C3 aHUS ranges from 8 months to 40 years.   Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down prematurely. In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them, leading to pallor, jaundice, fatigue, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. Thrombocytopenia occurs as platelets are consumed to make abnormal clots. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases. These life-threatening complications prevent the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively, often requiring dialysis. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which is caused by infection with strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce Shiga-like toxins. The typical form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger than 10. The typical form is less likely than the atypical form to involve recurrent attacks of kidney damage that lead to ESRD.   First line treatment for aHUS caused by AD mutations in C3 is plasma exchange or plasmapheresis. Dialysis may be necessary for removal of toxic metabolites. Eculizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the complement protein C5 can also be used in patients over 2 months of age. Eculizumab specifically binds with high affinity to the complement protein C5, inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. By inhibiting the complement cascade at this point, the normal, disease-preventing functions of the proximal complement system are largely preserved, while the properties of C5 that promote inflammation and cell destruction are impeded. Eculizumab carries a black box warning for the risk of meningococcal infections and can only be prescribed by doctors who have enrolled in and follow a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy required by the FDA. Due to the increased risk of meningococcal infections, meningococcal vaccination is recommended at least 2 weeks prior to receiving eculizumab, unless the risks of delaying eculizumab therapy outweigh the risk of developing a meningococcal infection, in which case the meningococcal vaccine should be administered as soon as possible. . Immunization against Streptococcus pneumonia, and Haemophilus influenza type B is also required.  It is also recommended that patients receive prophylactic antibiotics (ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin followed by penicillin V or erythromycin, if penicillin-allergic) as soon as they start eculizumab and should remain on them as long as they are taking eculizumab. Hypertension is treated with captopril. Bilateral nephrectomy has been used as a last resort treatment when extensive renal microvascular thrombosis, refractory hypertension, and signs of hypertensive encephalopathy are not responsive to conventional therapies, including plasmapheresis or plasma exchange therapy. Renal transplantation may be an option, although recurrence of disease in the graft may limit its usefulness.  The exact overall incidence and prevalence of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is unknown. One study placed the incidence in the United States at 2 individuals per 1 million in the general population. In Europe, the disorder is estimated to affect approximately .11 per 1 million individuals between the ages of 0-18. aHUS accounts for approximately 5-10% of all cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome. The prevalence and incidence of aHUS caused by variants in C3 is unknown.  ", "Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function.

Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure.Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate.Thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cells that normally assist with blood clotting. In people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream because a large number of platelets are used to make abnormal clots. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases.

The genetic changes that cause C3 deficiency lead to an altered version of the C3 protein or prevent cells from producing any of this protein. These mutations are described as \"loss-of-function\" because the abnormal or missing C3 protein prevents normal activation of the complement system. As a result, the immune system is less able to protect the body against foreign invaders (such as bacteria).  The main clinical manifestation of primary C3 deficiency is childhood-onset of recurrent infections, primarily with gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria meningitidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli), although gram-positive bacterial infections also occur. The most common types of infections associated with C3 deficiency are in the upper and lower respiratory tract (pneumonia, sinusitis, tonsillitis, otitis). Approximately 1/4 of patients diagnosed with C3 deficiency develop immune complex-mediated autoimmune diseases similar to systemic lupus erythematosus  and approximately 26% of patients develop mesangiocapillary or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, resulting in renal failure.  This condition is managed on a case-by-case basis with antibiotics appropriate for each episode of infection. Vaccination is beneficial to patients with C3 def because they are highly susceptible to infection with encapsulated bacteria.

The C5 gene encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into C5a and C5b. C5a functions as an anaphylatoxin with potent spasmogenic and chemotactic activity, while C5b is a subunit of the membrane attack complex (MAC), deficiency of which results in an increased susceptibility to infection, particularly with Neisseria spp.  The complement system (complement cascade) is a part of the  innate immune system which does not change during an individual's lifetime. The complement system is  recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system (humoral and cell mediated immunity that includes T and B cells).  The complement system consists of a number of proteins synthesized by the liver, that circulate in the blood as inactive precursors. When stimulated by one of several triggers, these precursors are cleaved with  the release of  cytokines and initiation of an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end result of complement activation  is stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material, inflammation to attract additional phagocytes, and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex (MAC).  Three pathways activate the complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin pathway. All lead to activation of the terminal pathway, which includes C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 with the ultimate formation of the MAC. The MAC creates a pore in the cell wall of invading microorganisms, resulting in cell lysis. Cleavage of many of these proteins also results in the formation of a number of biologically active fragments that act as anaphylatoxins, opsonins and chemotactic factors.     Deficiencies of terminal complement components are rare diseases and their diagnosis is likely underestimated. Meningococcal infection is common in individuals with late component complement deficiencies, affecting 40-50%, and may be the first manifestation of complement deficiency. The average age of onset is 17 years of age; only 10% of cases occur before 5 years of age. Severe pneumococcal and meningococcal infections can be fatal if not evaluated and treated adequately. Development of autoimmune disorders, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, is also associated with deficiencies of the terminal complement pathway. The prognosis depends on the rate of recurrence as well as severity of infection.     These conditions are managed on a case-by-case basis for each episode of infection. Due to the risk of infection with encapsulated microorganisms, patients should be made aware of the symptoms of meningococcal infection and seek care early. Affected individuals should receive all routine bacterial and viral immunizations, particularly meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccination which is an important aspect of treatment. There is no contraindication to live vaccines. Complement component replacement is not currently a recommended treatment.     All complement deficiencies represent approximately 1-6% of all primary immunodeficiencies. C5 deficiency seems to be more common in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa; however, the prevalence and incidence of C5 deficiency is not known.

The C6 protein normally participates in the terminal lytic phase of complement activation, an integral member of the membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC deficiency results in an increased susceptibility to infection, particularly with Neisseria spp.  The complement system (complement cascade) is a part of the  innate immune system which does not change during an individual's lifetime. The complement system is recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system (humoral and cell mediated immunity that includes T and B cells).  The complement system consists of a number of proteins synthesized by the liver, that circulate in the blood as inactive precursors. When stimulated by one of several triggers, these precursors are cleaved with the release of cytokines and initiation of an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end result of complement activation  is stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material, inflammation to attract additional phagocytes, and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex (MAC).  Three pathways activate the complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin pathway. All lead to activation of the terminal pathway, which includes C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 with the ultimate formation of the MAC. The MAC creates a pore in the cell wall of invading microorganisms, resulting in cell lysis. Cleavage of many of these proteins also results in the formation of a number of biologically active fragments that act as anaphylatoxins, opsonins and chemotactic factors.   Deficiencies of terminal complement components are rare diseases, and their diagnosis is likely underestimated. Meningococcal infection is common in individuals with late component complement deficiencies, affecting 40-50%, and may be the first manifestation of complement deficiency. The average age of onset is 17 years of age; only 10% of cases occur before 5 years of age. Severe pneumococcal and meningococcal infections can be fatal if not evaluated and treated adequately. Development of autoimmune disorders, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, is also associated with deficiencies of the terminal complement pathway. The prognosis depends on the rate of recurrence as well as severity of infection.  These conditions are managed on a case-by-case basis for each episode of infection. Due to the risk of infection with encapsulated microorganisms, patients should be made aware of the symptoms of meningococcal infection and seek care early. Affected individuals should receive all routine bacterial and viral immunizations, particularly meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccination which is an important aspect of treatment. There is no contraindication to live vaccines. The use of fresh frozen plasma to provide the missing component of the terminal complement cascade has been entertained; however, plasma infusions are not typically used in complement deficiencies since plasma contains proteins and enzymes from the whole complement cascade as well as regulators. This carries the theoretic risk of worsening the condition, the risk for bloodborne infections, and the risk of developing antibodies to exogenous complement proteins.  All complement deficiencies represent approximately 1-6% of all primary immunodeficiencies. C6 deficiency seems to be more common in individuals of African or African American descent. The exact prevalence and incidence of C6 deficiency remain unknown.

"clinical_summary": ["C8 type1 complement (C8a) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the C8A gene located on chromosome 1p32. The C8 component is a serum protein that consists of 3 non-identical subunits arranged asymmetrically as a disulfide-linked alpha (C8A)-gamma (C8G) dimer and a non-covalently associated beta chain (C8B). Each component is encoded by a different gene. normally participates in the terminal lytic phase of complement activation, an integral member of the membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC deficiency results in an increased susceptibility to infection, particularly with Neisseria spp.  The complement system (complement cascade) is a part of the  innate immune system which does not change during an individual's lifetime. The complement system is  recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system (humoral and cell mediated immunity that includes T and B cells).  The complement system consists of a number of proteins synthesized by the liver, that circulate in the blood as inactive precursors. When stimulated by one of several triggers, these precursors are cleaved with  the release of  cytokines and initiation of an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end result of complement activation  is stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material, inflammation to attract additional phagocytes, and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex (MAC).  Three pathways activate the complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin pathway. All lead to activation of the terminal pathway, which includes C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 with the ultimate formation of the MAC. The MAC creates a pore in the cell wall of invading microorganisms, resulting in cell lysis. Cleavage of many of these proteins also results in the formation of a number of biologically active fragments that act as anaphylatoxins, opsonins and chemotactic factors.     Deficiencies of terminal complement components are rare diseases and their diagnosis is likely underestimated. Meningococcal infection is common in individuals with late component complement deficiencies, affecting 40-50%, and may be the first manifestation of complement deficiency. . The average age of onset is 17 years of age; only 10% of cases occur before 5 years of age. Severe pneumococcal and meningococcal infections can be fatal if not evaluated and treated adequately. Development of autoimmune disorders, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, is also associated with deficiencies of the terminal complement pathway. The prognosis depends on the rate of recurrence as well as severity of infection.     These conditions are managed on a case-by-case basis for each episode of infection. Due to the risk of infection with encapsulated microorganisms, patients should be made aware of the symptoms of meningococcal infection and seek care early. Affected individuals should receive all routine bacterial and viral immunizations, particularly meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccination which is an important aspect of treatment. There is no contraindication to live vaccines. The use of fresh frozen plasma to provide the missing component of the terminal complement cascade has been considered; however, plasma infusions are not typically used in complement deficiencies since plasma contains proteins and enzymes from the whole complement cascade as well as regulators. This carries the theoretic risk of worsening the condition, the risk for bloodborn infections, and the risk of developing antibodies to exogenous complement proteins.

"condition": {"condition_name": "COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 9 DEFICIENCY", "clinical_summary": ["C9 complement deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the C9 gene located on chromosome 5p13.1. C9 normally participates in the terminal lytic phase of complement activation, an integral member of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The complex is assembled by sequential addition of 1 molecule each of C5b, C6, C7, and C8, and 6 to 16 molecules of the ninth component, C9. MAC deficiency results in an increased susceptibility to infection, particularly with Neisseria spp.  The complement system (complement cascade) is a part of the  innate immune system which does not change during an individual's lifetime. The complement system is  recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system (humoral and cell mediated immunity that includes T and B cells).   The complement system consists of a number of proteins synthesized by the liver, that circulate in the blood as inactive precursors. When stimulated by one of several triggers, these precursors are cleaved with  the release of  cytokines and initiation of an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end result of complement activation  is stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material, inflammation to attract additional phagocytes, and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex (MAC).  Three pathways activate the complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin pathway. All lead to activation of the terminal pathway, which includes C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 with the ultimate formation of the MAC. The MAC creates a pore in the cell wall of invading microorganisms, resulting in cell lysis. Cleavage of many of these proteins also results in the formation of a number of biologically active fragments that act as anaphylatoxins, opsonins and chemotactic factors.     Deficiencies of terminal complement components are rare diseases and their diagnosis is likely underestimated. Meningococcal infection is common in individuals with late component complement deficiencies, affecting 40-50%, and may be the first manifestation of complement deficiency. The average age of onset is 17 years of age; only 10% of cases occur before 5 years of age. Severe pneumococcal and meningococcal infections can be fatal if not evaluated and treated adequately. Development of autoimmune disorders, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, is also associated with deficiencies of the terminal complement pathway. The prognosis depends on the rate of recurrence as well as severity of infection.     These conditions are managed on a case-by-case basis for each episode of infection. Due to the risk of infection with encapsulated microorganisms, patients should be made aware of the symptoms of meningococcal infection and seek care early. Affected individuals should receive all routine bacterial and viral immunizations, particularly meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccination which is an important aspect of treatment. There is no contraindication to live vaccines. The use of fresh frozen plasma to provide the missing component of the terminal complement cascade has been considered; however, plasma infusions are not typically used in complement deficiencies since plasma contains proteins and enzymes from the whole complement cascade as well as regulators. This carries the theoretic risk of worsening the condition, the risk for bloodborne infections, and the risk of developing antibodies to exogenous complement proteins.     All complement deficiencies represent approximately 1-6% of all primary immunodeficiencies. Deficiency of C9 is one of the most common genetic abnormalities in Japan with an incidence of 1 homozygote in 1,000 but is much less common in Caucasian population. The prevalence and incidence of C9 deficiency in non-Japanese populations  is not known.

The ADAMTS13 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in regulating blood clotting. The ADAMTS13 enzyme processes a large protein called von Willebrand factor (vWF).  vWF is involved in the first step of blood clotting at the site of injury by facilitating platelet aggregation and attachment to the walls of blood vessels, forming temporary clots. The ADAMTS13 enzyme cuts vWF into smaller pieces to regulate its interaction with platelets. By processing von Willebrand factor in this way, the enzyme prevents it from triggering the formation of blood clots in normal circulation.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare disorder that causes blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they block vessels and restrict blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. Complications resulting from these clots can include neurological problems (such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech), fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain, and heart problems. Blood clots normally form to stop blood loss at the sites of blood vessel injury. In people with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, clots develop even in the absence of apparent injury. Blood clots are formed from clumps of cells called platelets that circulate in the blood and assist with clotting. Because a large number of platelets are used to make clots in people with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream (thrombocytopenia). Thrombocytopenia can lead to small areas of bleeding just under the surface of the skin, resulting in purplish spots called purpura. This disorder also causes premature red blood cell hemolysis. A condition called hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to pallor, jaundice, fatigue, tachypnea, and tachycardia. There are two major forms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, an acquired (noninherited) form and a familial (inherited) form. The acquired form usually appears in late childhood or adulthood. Affected individuals may have a single episode of signs and symptoms, or, more commonly, they may experience multiple recurrences over time. The familial form of this disorder is much rarer and typically appears in infancy or early childhood, although it can appear later in life. In people with the familial form, signs and symptoms often recur on a regular basis and may return during times of stress, such as during illness or pregnancy.  First line therapy for hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is provision of fresh frozen plasma, although this will likely change as apadamtase alfa, a human recombinant form of ADAMTS13 has been shown to be effective and will likely be FDA approved in the near future. It is currently available for off-label use. Other treatments include plasma exchange therapy and phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice. Plasma derived human coagulation factor VIII/vWF complex has also been used.  The precise incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is unknown. Congenital TTP is much less common than immune-mediated TTP, accounting for up to only 5% of all TTP cases. Up until 2017, 123 cases had been reported by the International Hereditary Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Registry. The annual incidence is estimated at less than 1/1,000,000.

The severity of this condition varies among affected individuals, although it is often life-threatening due to the heart problems.Timothy syndrome is characterized by a heart condition called long QT syndrome, which causes the heart (cardiac) muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. This abnormality in the heart's electrical system can cause severe abnormalities of the heart rhythm (arrhythmias), which can lead to sudden death. Some people with Timothy syndrome are also born with structural heart defects (cardiomyopathy) that affect the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. As a result of these serious heart problems, many people with Timothy syndrome live only into childhood. In about 80 percent of cases of Timothy syndrome, the cause of death is a severe form of arrhythmia called ventricular tachycardia, in which the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) beat abnormally fast, often leading to cardiac arrest and sudden death.Timothy syndrome is also characterized by webbing or fusion of the skin between some fingers or toes (cutaneous syndactyly). About half of affected people have distinctive facial features such as a flattened nasal bridge, low-set ears, a small upper jaw, and a thin upper lip. Children with this condition have small, misplaced teeth and frequent cavities (dental caries). Additional signs and symptoms of Timothy syndrome can include baldness at birth, frequent infections, episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia).Researchers have found that many children with Timothy syndrome have the characteristic features of autism or similar conditions known as autistic spectrum disorders.

The most relevant heart manifestation of LQT8 is the prolongation of the time required by the heart to complete a cycle of its electrical activity, known as the \"QT interval\". It belongs to a heterogeneous group of diseases collectively classified as \"long QT syndrome\" or LQTS. The QT interval prolongation predisposes patients to a high risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias and experiencing cardiac arrest from a very young age. Congenital long QT syndrome is electrocardiographically characterized by a prolonged QT interval and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias (torsade de pointes). These cardiac arrhythmias may result in recurrent syncope, seizure, or sudden death. Available treatments include orally administrated medications (\"antiarrhythmics\") and implantable devices like pacemakers (PM) or implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD).  While mutations in CACNA1C are often associated with Timothy syndrome, a rare multisystem genetic disorder affecting the heart and several other organs, including the skeleton, metabolic system, and brain, it has become apparent that CACNA1C mutations also cause LQTS without extracardiac phenotypes and can result in QT prolongation and/or fatal arrhythmia attacks. The phenotype can be highly variable, even within the same family, ranging from no apparent effect, asymptomatic QT interval prolongation on electrocardiogram, to episodes of presyncope and syncope, ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.

The signs and symptoms of this type are similar to type A, but not as severe. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B often have hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent lung infections, and a low number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). They also have short stature and slowed mineralization of bone (delayed bone age). About one-third of affected individuals have the cherry-red spot eye abnormality or neurological impairment. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B usually survive into adulthood.The signs and symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are very similar; these types differ only in their genetic cause. Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 usually become apparent in childhood, although signs and symptoms can develop at any time. People with these types usually develop difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), an inability to move the eyes vertically (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy), poor muscle tone (dystonia), severe liver disease, and interstitial lung disease. Individuals with Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 have problems with speech and swallowing that worsen over time, eventually interfering with feeding.

This condition is characterized by neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction, a lack of response to G-CSF, life-threatening infections, bone marrow fibrosis, and renal extramedullary hematopoiesis. It is one of several inherited severe congenital neutropenias.  Severe congenital neutropenia is a condition that causes affected individuals to be prone to recurrent infections. People with this condition have a deficiency of neutrophils, a white blood cell that plays a role in inflammation and in fighting infection. The deficiency of neutrophils, called neutropenia, is apparent at birth or soon afterward.

In people with severe congenital neutropenia, these bone disorders can begin at any time from infancy through adulthood. Unlike several other severe congenital neutropenias, people with severe congenital neutropenia-5 have not been reported to develop certain cancerous conditions of the blood, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia during adolescence. Individuals with severe congenital neutropenia-5 may have poor weight gain, enlarged kidneys due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, psychomotor delay, ophthalmological problems, such as optic nerve hypoplasia/retinal dystrophy and hearing loss.  Other health problems such as seizures, congenital heart defects and genital abnormalities, described in other forms of severe congenital neutropenia have not been described.  Patients with VPS45 gene mutations can be supported for some time with antimicrobial therapy and regular transfusion of blood and platelets; hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only treatment for this condition.  Even with transplantation, survival is not guaranteed.

The AMN gene, on chromosome 14q32.32, provides instructions for making a protein called amnionless. It interacts with a protein called cubulin encoded by the CUBN gene. Together, these proteins play a role in the uptake of vitamin B12 from food. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin binds to it. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidney, the amnionless and cubilin proteins are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.  Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome is a recessively inherited condition caused by low levels of vitamin B12 (cobalamin). The primary feature of this condition is megaloblastic anemia. In this form of anemia, which is a disorder characterized by the shortage of red blood cells, the red cells that are present are abnormally large. About half of people with Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome also have high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria). Although proteinuria can be an indication of kidney problems, people with Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome appear to have normal kidney function.  Symptoms of Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome typically begin in infancy or early childhood. The blood abnormality leads to many of the signs and symptoms of the condition, including an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), pale skin (pallor), excessive tiredness (fatigue), and recurring gastrointestinal or respiratory infections. Other features of Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome include mild neurological problems, such as weak muscle tone (hypotonia), numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, movement problems, delayed development, or confusion. Rarely, affected individuals have abnormalities of organs or tissues that make up the urinary tract, such as the bladder or the ureters.  Intramuscular injections of hydroxycobalamin  are used to treat this condition since absorption of B12 from the GI tract is impaired. Hydroxycobalamin is preferred to cyanocobalamin.  Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome is a rare condition that was first described in Finland and Norway; in these regions, the condition is estimated to affect 1 in 200,000 people. The condition has also been reported in other countries worldwide; its prevalence in these countries is unknown.

"clinical_summary": ["Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (classic homocystinuria) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of sulfur metabolism caused by variants in the CBS gene located on chromosome 21q22.3. The CBS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cystathionine beta-synthase. This enzyme, along with the cofactor B6 (pyridoxine) is responsible for converting homocysteine and serine to cystathionine. Another enzyme then converts cystathionine to the amino acid cysteine, which is either used to build proteins or is broken down and excreted in urine. There are 2 main phenotypes, a milder pyridoxine (vitamin B6)-responsive form, and a more severe pyridoxine-nonresponsive form. Infants with homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency are normal at birth, but, if left untreated, will slowly develop the various symptoms associated with the disorder. Prompt detection and treatment of homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency is important in preventing or reducing the symptoms associated with the disorder. The signs and symptoms of homocystinuria typically develop within the first year of life, although some mildly affected people may not develop features until later in childhood or adulthood. The clinical features of untreated homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency include myopia, ectopia lentis, mental retardation, skeletal anomalies similar to Marfan syndrome and thromboembolic events. Light hair and skin may also be present. Biochemical features include increased urinary excretion of homocystine and methionine.   The treatment of homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency is directed toward preventing or reducing the symptoms commonly associated with the disorder by controlling plasma levels of homocysteine. Treatment may include therapy with pyridoxine (vitamin B6), a diet that restricts the intake of protein and methionine, betaine therapy, and supplementation with folate/folinic acid (vitamin B9) or cobalamin (vitamin B12). ). Betaine acts as a methyl donor for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, increasing the plasma and tissue concentrations of methionine while reducing homocysteine levels. The efficacy of betaine in the treatment of homocystinuria is well established.  The most common form of homocystinuria affects at least 1 in 200,000 to 335,000 people worldwide. The disorder appears to be more common in some countries, such as Ireland (1 in 65,000), Germany (1 in 17,800), Norway (1 in 6,400), and Qatar (1 in 1,800).

The product of this gene is an important component of the T cell receptor; deficiency results in a selective loss of T cell receptor function. The T cell antigen receptor is a protein complex consisting of alpha and beta subunits, which are joined by disulfide bonds, and four other subunits:  epsilon (CD3E), delta (CD3D), gamma (CD3G), and zeta (CD3Z). The T cell-receptor consists of paired, mutually exclusive heterodimers of alpha and beta or gamma and delta variant chains, in association with invariant CD3G, CD3D, CD3E, and CD3Z chains. During development, the CD3/T cell receptor protein complex plays an important part in the transition of thymocytes from immature precursors to the final mature CD4+ or CD8+ positive T cell. Selective deficiency of CD3D results in a partial arrest of T-cell maturation resulting in immunodeficiency.  Immunodeficiency-19 is characterized by early infantile onset of recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Chronic diarrhea, recurrent respiratory infections and failure to thrive are common features of the condition.  Immunologic work-up is consistent with a T cell-negative, B cell-positive, natural killer (NK) cell-positive phenotype. The disorder is lethal in early childhood without bone marrow transplantation.  Treatment revolves around preventing infection prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This includes avoiding sick contacts and avoiding breast feeding to prevent infection that can affect the success of bone marrow transplantation. It also includes antimicrobial prophylaxis [PCP prophylaxis- TMP/SMX at one month (alternative atovaquone); HSV/VSV prophylaxis- acyclovir at time of diagnosis; RSV prophylaxis- palivizumab at one  month of age during peak RSV season; General bacterial/viral prophylaxis- IVIG  starting at one month of age; Antifungal prophylaxis-fluconazole (alternative micafungin) starting at one month]. If diagnosis is delayed and infections occur, these must be aggressively treated. HSCT is usually delayed to 3-6 months of age, although may occur earlier if necessary. If the  infant remains on prophylactic measures with excellent compliance and close follow-up, short delays in referring to transplant are generally well tolerated. Gene therapy remains investigational.  All types of SCID are very rare disorders that occur in approximately 1 or fewer births in 100,000 in the United States. SCID may be more common in people with Navajo, Apache, or Turkish ancestry. The prevalence and incidence of SCID caused by variants in CD3D is unknown.

"clinical_summary": ["Immunodeficiency-18 is a rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by onset in infancy or early childhood of recurrent infections. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the CD3E gene, located on chromosome 11q23.3.  The severity is variable, encompassing both a mild immunodeficiency and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), resulting in early death without bone marrow transplantation in some patients. Immunologic work-up of the IMD18 SCID patients shows a T cell-negative, B cell-positive, natural killer (NK) cell-positive phenotype, whereas T-cell development is not impaired in the mild form of IMD18. The product of this gene is an important component of the T cell receptor.  The protein encoded by CD3E is the CD3-epsilon polypeptide, which together with CD3-gamma, -delta and -zeta, and the T-cell receptor alpha/beta and gamma/delta heterodimers, forms the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex. This complex is important in coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular signal-transduction pathways. The epsilon polypeptide plays an essential role in T-cell development.  Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a group of rare monogenic primary immunodeficiency disorders characterized by a lack of functional peripheral T lymphocytes. They are classified according to immunological phenotype into SCID with absence of T cells but presence of B cells (T-B+ SCID) or SCID with absence of both (T-B- SCID). Both of these groups include several forms, with or without NK cells. SCID usually presents within the first few months of life with failure to thrive, severe infections (pneumonia, gastrointestinal infections, sepsis), recurrent or persistent thrush, chronic diarrhea, and/or absent lymph nodes. Patients have an increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections (usually in the respiratory tract and the gut) most often due to P. jiroveci, some viruses (e.g. Cytomegalovirus, adenovirus) and fungi. Alopecia and skin rash may be present depending on the form. Patients are unable to produce specific antibodies after vaccination or natural infection.   Treatment is based on use of continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis (usually started at about one month of age), immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and strict hygiene measures. Breast feeding is contraindicated due to the risk of CMV infection. Permanent cure requires immune reconstitution, most often achieved by allogenic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), usually done at 3-6 months of age. Without treatment SCID usually results in severe infection and death in children by age 2. When performed from an HLA-identical sibling, and in the first few months of life, HSCT can result in a greater than 90% long-term survival rate.  Overall incidence of SCID is estimated at about 1/50,000 live births, with regional differences and higher incidences among populations with a higher consanguinity rate. The incidence and prevalence of SCID caused by CD3E mutations are unknown.

["Primary coenzyme Q10 deficienc, a disorder that involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10, can be caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the COQ8A (ADCK3) gene on chromosome 1q42.13. The COQ8A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, which has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use. Coenzyme Q10 is also involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.  At least 36 mutations in the COQ8A gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ8A gene mutations associated with this disorder change the structure of the COQ8A protein or prevent its production, which impairs the normal production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This subtype of CoQ10 def typically does not respond to CoQ10 (ubiquinol), but can still be tried.  ", "Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a disorder that can affect many parts of the body, especially the brain, muscles, and kidneys. As its name suggests, the disorder involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10.The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency vary widely. In the most severe cases, the condition becomes apparent in infancy and causes severe brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and the failure of other body systems. These problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency can begin as late as a person's sixties and often cause cerebellar ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movement (cerebellum). Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency include seizures, intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), vision loss caused by degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves or breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and sensorineural hearing loss (which is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). The neurological problems gradually get worse unless treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation.A type of kidney dysfunction called nephrotic syndrome is another common feature of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It can occur with or without neurological abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when damage to the kidneys impairs their function, which allows protein from the blood to pass into the urine (proteinuria). Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include increased cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema). Affected individuals may also have blood in the urine (hematuria), which can lead to a reduced number of red blood cells in the body (anemia), abnormal blood clotting, or reduced amounts of certain white blood cells. Low white blood cell counts can lead to a weakened immune system and frequent infections in people with nephrotic syndrome. If not treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation, affected individuals eventually develop irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).A type of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can also occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency."], "alternate_names": ["COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 4"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 16812.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "COQ8A"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Ubidecarenone"}, {"int_description_2": "Idebenone"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "ADCK3-related Coenzyme Q10 Deficiency: A Potentially Treatable Genetic Disease.", "pmid_1": 30637285.0, "pmid_date_1": 2018.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Movement disorders clinical practice"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Cerebellar ataxia and severe muscle CoQ10 deficiency in a patient with a novel mutation in ADCK3.", "pmid_2": 26818466.0, "pmid_date_2": 2016.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Clinical genetics"}, {"pmid_title_3": "ADCK3 mutations with epilepsy, stroke-like episodes and ataxia: a POLG mimic?", "pmid_3": 27106809.0, "pmid_date_3": 2016.0, "pmid_journal_3": "European journal of neurology"}, {"pmid_title_4": "Heterozygous Mutations in the ADCK3 Gene in Siblings with Cerebellar Atrophy and Extreme Phenotypic Variability.", "pmid_4": 24048965.0, "pmid_date_4": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_4": "JIMD reports"}, {"pmid_title_5": "Autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia caused by a novel ADCK3 mutation that elongates the protein: clinical, genetic and biochemical characterisation.", "pmid_5": 24218524.0, "pmid_date_5": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_5": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry"}, {"pmid_title_6": "Phenotypic variability in ARCA2 and identification of a core ataxic phenotype with slow progression.", "pmid_6": 24164873.0, "pmid_date_6": 2013.0, "pmid_journal_6": "Orphanet journal of rare diseases"}, {"pmid_title_7": "Adult-onset cerebellar ataxia due to mutations in CABC1/ADCK3.", "pmid_7": 22036850.0, "pmid_date_7": 2012.0, "pmid_journal_7": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry"}, {"pmid_title_8": "Coenzyme Q(10)-responsive ataxia: 2-year-treatment follow-up.", "pmid_8": 20629161.0, "pmid_date_8": 2010.0, "pmid_journal_8": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society"}]}, {"_id": "16902-OMIM:614923", "condition": {"condition_name": "BRANCHED-CHAIN KETO ACID DEHYDROGENASE KINASE DEFICIENCY; BCKDKD", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease caused by variants in the BCKDK gene on chromosome 16p11.2.

The pressure allows the blood to make its way through the arteries to the smaller vessels (arterioles and capillaries) that supply oxygen to the body's tissues. By the time blood reaches the capillaries, the pressure is much lower. The blood then proceeds from the capillaries into veins, through which it eventually returns to the heart.In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, some arterial vessels flow directly into veins rather than into the capillaries. These abnormalities are called arteriovenous malformations. When they occur in vessels near the surface of the skin, where they are visible as red markings, they are known as telangiectases (the singular is telangiectasia).Without the normal buffer of the capillaries, the blood moves from the arteries at high pressure into the thinner walled, less elastic veins. The extra pressure tends to strain and enlarge these blood vessels, and may result in compression or irritation of adjacent tissues and frequent episodes of severe bleeding (hemorrhage). Nosebleeds are very common in people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and more serious problems may arise from hemorrhages in the brain, liver, lungs, or other organs.There are several forms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, distinguished mainly by their genetic cause but with some differences in patterns of signs and symptoms. People with type 1 tend to develop symptoms earlier than those with type 2, and are more likely to have blood vessel malformations in the lungs and brain. Type 2 and type 3 may be associated with a higher risk of liver involvement. Women are more likely than men to develop blood vessel malformations in the lungs with type 1, and are also at higher risk of liver involvement with both type 1 and type 2.

Most cases of Omenn syndrome are caused by variants in either RAG1 or RAG2; however, variants in the DCLRE1C gene (also known as ARTEMIS) can also cause Omenn Syndrome. This gene is involved in V(D)J recombination which is required for B- and T-cell development. In addition to Omenn syndrome, variants in DCLRE1C have been reported to cause atypical severe combined immunodeficiency, Hyper-IgM syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, all with the hallmark finding of severely impaired T-cell immunity.  The DCLRE1C gene, located on chromosome10p,  encodes the protein ARTEMIS. ARTEMIS is a nuclease with single-stranded 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease potential and endonuclease activity over 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. It is essential for V(D)J rearrangement and for DNA repair.

Patients are at an increased risk of developing lymphoma.  Immediate management revolves around treatment of acute infections. Live viral vaccines are contraindicated and should be avoided. Only irradiated, CMV negative blood products should be used (to prevent graft versus host disease and infections). Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis should be implemented with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and IVIG replacement therapy should be given. HLA-typing of the patient and any siblings should be done as soon as the diagnosis is made in preparation for potential hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Supportive therapy is usually insufficient for long-term survival: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is necessary for long-term survival.  Patients transplanted before 3 months of age have a greater survival while patients who are transplanted later and have suffered end organ damage from infections have a much lower success rate. Overall, patients with T-B- SCID have less successful HSCT outcomes than patients with T-B+ SCID. Excessive exposure to radiation in the form of imaging studies should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Gene therapy is currently under investigation.  The prevalence and incidence of DCLRE1C Omenn syndrome/Severe Combined Immunodeficiency are not known.   ", "Omenn syndrome is an inherited disorder of the immune system (immunodeficiency). Omenn syndrome is one of several forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a group of disorders that cause individuals to have virtually no immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Individuals with SCID are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. Infants with Omenn syndrome typically experience pneumonia and chronic diarrhea. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with this disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people.In addition to immunodeficiency, children with Omenn syndrome develop autoimmunity, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. This abnormal immune reaction can cause very red skin (erythroderma), hair loss (alopecia), and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). In addition, affected individuals have enlargement of tissues that produce infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes. These include the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone, and lymph nodes, which are found throughout the body.If not treated in a way that restores immune function, children with Omenn syndrome usually survive only until age 1 or 2."], "alternate_names": ["OMENN SYNDROME", "SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION"]}, "gene information":

chromosome 10p12.1. PDSS1 encodes a protein that is part of a heterotetramer with the protein product of PDSS2 (chromosome 6q21). This heterotetrameric enzyme, trans-prenyltransferase,  catalyzes the synthesis of all trans-polyprenyl pyrophosphates from isopentyl diphosphate, the prenyl side chain of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, ubiquinone), which is the first step in CoQ10  biosynthesis. CoQ10 is an essential component of cells that plays crucial roles in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, regulating apoptosis, and pyrimidine synthesis.  Deficiency can also lead to increased reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress.    Of the five patients reported to date, all had mild intellectual disability and/or developmental delay. One, who died at 15 months of age,  had leukoencephalopathy with CNS lactic acid peaks on MRS and nephrotic syndrome. Sensorineural hearing loss, optic atrophy  and weakness/exercise intolerance were seen in the other 4 cases. Three of the four surviving patients, where diagnosis was made between 6 and 14 years of age, developed a cardiac valvulopathy. Obesity, peripheral neuropathy and lactic acidosis were seen in 2 of these 4 patients. Of note, optic atrophy has been reported to precede hearing loss.  Despite limited evidence, high dose CoQ10 replacement therapy should be initiated early to try to prevent progression of disease.  This is a very rare condition. To date, only 5 cases have been reported in the literature.  ", "Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a disorder that can affect many parts of the body, especially the brain, muscles, and kidneys. As its name suggests, the disorder involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10.The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency vary widely. In the most severe cases, the condition becomes apparent in infancy and causes severe brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and the failure of other body systems. These problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency can begin as late as a person's sixties and often cause cerebellar ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movement (cerebellum). Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency include seizures, intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), vision loss caused by degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves or breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and sensorineural hearing loss (which is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). The neurological problems gradually get worse unless treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation.A type of kidney dysfunction called nephrotic syndrome is another common feature of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It can occur with or without neurological abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when damage to the kidneys impairs their function, which allows protein from the blood to pass into the urine (proteinuria). Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include increased cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema). Affected individuals may also have blood in the urine (hematuria), which can lead to a reduced number of red blood cells in the body (anemia), abnormal blood clotting, or reduced amounts of certain white blood cells. Low white blood cell counts can lead to a weakened immune system and frequent infections in people with nephrotic syndrome. If not treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation, affected individuals eventually develop irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).A type of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can also occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency."], "alternate_names": ["COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 2; COQ10D2"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 17759.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "PDSS1"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Ubidecarenone"}, {"int_description_2": "Ubiquinol"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Genetic bases and clinical manifestations of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ 10) deficiency.", "pmid_1": 25091424.0, "pmid_date_1": 2015.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Journal of inherited metabolic disease"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Genetics of coenzyme q10 deficiency.", "pmid_2": 25126048.0, "pmid_date_2": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Molecular syndromology"}]}, {"_id": "1786-OMIM:130650", "condition": {"condition_name": "BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN SYNDROME; BWS", "freq_per_birth": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome affects 1 in 10,500 to 13,700 newborns worldwide.

Pathogenic variants in this gene can also cause the dominant condition known as IMAGe syndrome. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome caused by mutations in CDKN1C results from loss of function of this gene, while IMAGe syndrome is thought to result from gain-of-function variants. CDKN1C is part of a cluster of genes on the short arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 2 (IC2) or KvDMR controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of CDKN1C and several other genes thought to help regulate growth. The IC2 region undergoes a process called methylation. Methylation, which occurs during the formation of an egg or sperm cell, is a way of marking or \"stamping\" the parent of origin. The IC2 region is normally methylated only on the maternally inherited copy of chromosome 11. This gene is imprinted with preferential expression of the maternal allele, meaning that the maternally inherited copy has much higher activity than the paternally inherited copy.  It encodes a protein that is a tight-binding, strong inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes and acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation and as a tumor suppressor preventing uncontrolled cell growth.  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that causes overgrowth and has other signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. At least half of all cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome result from changes in methylation of the IC2 region. Specifically, the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region is hypomethylated. This abnormality disrupts the regulation of several genes that are normally controlled by IC2, including CDKN1C. Because this gene normally restrains cell growth and division, a reduction in its activity leads to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can also result from pathogenic variants within the maternally inherited copy of the CDKN1C gene  not related to methylation. These variants are described as \"loss-of-function\" because they alter the structure of the CDKN1C protein such that it can no longer control growth effectively. The resulting problems with growth regulation lead to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.   Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an omphalocele. Other abdominal wall defects, such as umbilical hernias, are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have macroglossia, which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include visceromegaly, creases or pits in the skin near the ears, hypoglycemia in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly Wilms tumor and  hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.

The condition is described as having an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern because one copy of the altered CDKN1C gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, because this gene is paternally imprinted, IMAGe syndrome results only when the mutation is present on the maternally inherited copy of the gene. When a mutation affects the paternally inherited copy of the CDKN1C gene, it does not cause health problems. Therefore, IMAGe syndrome is passed only from mothers to their children. Pathogenic variants in this gene can also cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Russell-Silver syndrome. Unlike Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is caused by loss of function of this gene, IMAGe syndrome is thought to result from a gain-of-function mechanism caused by mutations in the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) domain of CDKN1C.

Variants in CDKN1C represent a rare cause of this condition,  inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with maternal transmission. The CDKN1C gene is located on chromosome 11p15.4. The CDKN1C gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate growth. This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. It also is involved in controlling growth before birth, preventing the developing fetus from becoming too large. People inherit one copy of most genes from their mother and one copy from their father. Both copies are typically active, or \"turned on,\" in cells. However, the activity of the CDKN1C gene depends on which parent it was inherited from (genomic imprinting). In most tissues, the copy of the gene inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) has much higher activity than the copy inherited from the father (the paternally inherited copy). SRS is a disorder of growth characterized by slow growth pre- and postnatally. Infants have a low birth weight and fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate. Head growth is normal, thus the head may appear large in comparison to the rest of the body. Affected infants and children are thin and have poor appetites.  Recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia may occur related to feeding difficulties. Many children with SRS have a small, triangular face with distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, a narrow chin, a small jaw, and downturned corners of the mouth. Other features of this disorder can include clinodacytly, asymmetric or uneven growth of some parts of the body, and digestive system abnormalities. SRS is also associated with an increased risk of delayed development, speech and language problems, and learning disabilities. Adults with SRS are short (average height for males is about 151 cm, average height for females is about 140 cm). Treatment may include growth hormone therapy. Treatment also includes prevention of or aggressive management of hypoglycemia.  Feeding disorders are managed by provision of nutritional and caloric supplements, medication for gastroesophageal reflux, therapy for oral motor problems and feeding aversion and cyproheptadine for appetite stimulation. Enteral tube feeding may be needed.  Lower-limb length discrepancy may require orthopedic surgical intervention. Physical, occupational, speech, and language therapy are used to treat delays. A multidisciplinary craniofacial team should be involved for management of severe micrognathia or cleft palate, if present. Males with cryptorchidism or hypospadias should be referred to a urologist. Referral to a multidisciplinary disorders of sexual development center should be considered if males present with micropenis or females present with internal genitourinary anomalies.  The exact incidence of SRS syndrome is unknown. Worldwide estimates range from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 100,000 people. Variants in CDKN1C are a very rare cause of SRS.

IRAK4 functions in signaling innate immune responses from IL-1/Toll-like receptors (TLR) and generation of the inflammatory cascade. IRAK-4 is considered the \"master IRAK\" in the mammalian IRAK family because it is the only component in the IL-1/TLR signaling pathway that is absolutely crucial to its functioning. The loss of IRAK4 or its  intrinsic kinase activity results in the loss of signaling through the pathway and the inability of the cell to release proinflammatory signals or to trigger innate immune responses.    IRAK-4 deficiency results in a primary immunodeficiency of the innate immune system.  Most individuals with this condition have their first bacterial infection before age 2, and the infections can be life-threatening in infancy and childhood.

In contrast, patients seem to be resistant to infection caused by most other bacteria, parasites and viruses although fungal infections have been rarely reported. Although routine immunological evaluations are normal (normal levels of B cells, T cells and NK cells), patients display reduced inflammatory responses and neutropenia during infectious episodes. More detailed immunologic studies show impaired cytokine responses to lipopolysaccharide and IL1B stimulation with normal response to TNFA.  Patients may not develop a high fever in response to these infections, even if the infection is severe.   The prognosis for most patients is good, with infections becoming less frequent with age.

The ADA gene encodes the enzyme adenosine deaminase which catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to deoxyinosine in the purine catabolic pathway. This enzyme is found in all cell types but is most highly expressed in lymphocytes. Deoxyadenosine is toxic to lymphocytes so the enzyme functions to convert it to deoxyinosine, which is not harmful.    Adenosine deaminase deficiency results in damage to the immune system and causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Individuals with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be serious or life-threatening. Infections are often caused by opportunistic organisms that ordinarily would not cause disease in individuals with functioning immune systems,    The main symptoms of ADA deficiency are pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. Affected children also grow much more slowly than healthy children and some have developmental delay.  Symptoms appear in infancy and most affected individuals are diagnosed with SCID in the first 6 months of life. Without treatment, these babies usually do not survive past age 2. In about 10 percent to 15 percent of cases, onset of immune deficiency is delayed to between 6 and 24 months of age (delayed onset) or even until adulthood (late onset). Immune deficiency in these later-onset cases tends to be less severe, causing primarily recurrent upper respiratory and ear infections. Over time, affected individuals may develop chronic lung damage, malnutrition, and other health problems.  The treatment of severe combined immune deficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency  includes early diagnosis and treatment of bacterial, viral and fungal infections, antimicrobial prophylaxis (including IVIG and other prophylactic measures), avoidance of breastfeeding (as CMV can be passed through breast milk) and avoidance of contact with ill individuals. The primary treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using a healthy matched sibling as a donor. This treatment is effective in approximately 70% of individuals with SCID, including that caused by ADA deficiency. ADA enzyme replacement therapy (Elapegademase, Pegademase, Polyethylene glycol-modified adenosine deaminase) should be given to all newly-diagnosed patients as an immediate stabilizing measure. It is considered a bridge therapy for a few months to ~2 years prior to HSCT or HSCT-gene therapy.    Autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy using either gamma-retrovirus vectors (Strimvelis, currently approved in Europe only for patients for whom no suitable matched sibling donor or matched family donor is available) or self-inactivating lentivirus vectors  has been under development and can be considered, if available and no suitable matched sibling donor or matched family donor should now be considered as one of the first line treatment choices (PMID 30194989). Transplantation is usually performed after 3-6 months of age.  Adenosine deaminase deficiency is very rare and is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 200,000 to 1,000,000 newborns worldwide. This disorder is responsible for approximately 15 percent of SCID cases.

The exact prevalence of Omenn syndrome is unknown.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by mutations in the ADA gene on chromosome 20q13.12. The function of the adenosine deaminase enzyme is to eliminate deoxyadenosine, which is generated when DNA is broken down. Adenosine deaminase converts deoxyadenosine, which is toxic to lymphocytes, to another molecule called deoxyinosine, which is not harmful.  The highest levels of adenosine deaminase are found in lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues.  This disorder damages the immune system and causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. These infections are often caused by \"opportunistic\" organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system. The main symptoms of ADA deficiency are pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. Affected children also grow much more slowly than healthy children and some have developmental delay. Rarely, ADA has been associated with Omenn syndrome, a distinct manifestation of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency. Patients with Omenn syndrome usually present in infancy with viral or fungal pneumonitis, chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive along with erythroderma, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, eosinophila, elevated IgE and alopecia. Most individuals with ADA deficiency are diagnosed with SCID in the first 6 months of life. Without treatment, these babies usually do not survive past age 2. In about 10 percent to 15 percent of cases, onset of immune deficiency is delayed to between 6 and 24 months of age (delayed onset) or even until adulthood (late onset). Immune deficiency in these later-onset cases tends to be less severe, causing primarily recurrent upper respiratory and ear infections. Over time, affected individuals may develop chronic lung damage, malnutrition, and other health problems.  Infections are treated with specific antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral agents and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. The preferred treatment for restoration of a functional immune system is bone marrow/stem cell transplantation from an HLA-identical healthy relative. For individuals who lack an HLA-identical related donor, treatment is by bone marrow/stem cell transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor, an HLA-haploidentical donor or umbilical cord-derived stem cells. Enzyme replacement therapy with polyethylene glycol-modified bovine adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA) is another treatment option for these patients. If not treated in a way that restores immune function, children with ADA/Omenn syndrome usually survive only until age 1 or 2.  Adenosine deaminase deficiency is very rare and is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 200,000 to 1,000,000 newborns worldwide. This disorder is responsible for approximately 15 percent of SCID cases.  ", "Omenn syndrome is an inherited disorder of the immune system (immunodeficiency). Omenn syndrome is one of several forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a group of disorders that cause individuals to have virtually no immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Individuals with SCID are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. Infants with Omenn syndrome typically experience pneumonia and chronic diarrhea. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with this disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people.In addition to immunodeficiency, children with Omenn syndrome develop autoimmunity, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. This abnormal immune reaction can cause very red skin (erythroderma), hair loss (alopecia), and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). In addition, affected individuals have enlargement of tissues that produce infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes. These include the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone, and lymph nodes, which are found throughout the body.If not treated in a way that restores immune function, children with Omenn syndrome usually survive only until age 1 or 2."], "alternate_names": ["Omenn syndrome", "SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, T CELL-NEGATIVE, B CELL-NEGATIVE, NK

characterized by the buildup of thick, sticky mucus often resulting in progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive system problems.  In addition to chronic lung infections and bulky malorodorus diarrhea, short stature is also a common feature. The symptoms of the disorder and their severity varies among affected individuals. It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene, which encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, located on chromosome 7q31.2. Most patients in the Caucasian population (~70%) are homozygous for the delta F508 allele.  There is some variation in prevalence across different populations; however, in the US, in white newborn infants, it occurs in about 1 in 2500 to 1 in 3500 newborns. It is less common in other ethnic groups, affecting about 1 in 17,000 African Americans and 1 in 31,000 Asian Americans.    There is poor genotype/phenotype correlation, but mutations that are associated with pancreatic insufficiency tend to result in more severe phenotypes. Pathogenic variants in this gene also cause the recessive condition congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens and are associated with the dominant conditions Modifier of bronchiectasis with or without elevated sweat chloride 1 and Hereditary Pancreatitis. In some  cases diagnosis confirmation with the Iontophoretic sweat chloride test may be needed.  The CFTR protein forms a channel that transports negatively charged chloride ions into and out of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears and digestive enzymes. This transport is important in controlling the movement of water into and out of tissues, which is required for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus.     Cystic fibrosis is on the recommended universal newborn screening panel in the United States; thus, most cases are identified by newborn screening. Some neonates may present early with meconium plug syndrome, or intussusception which often requires surgical intervention if untreated, abnormal secretions, inflammation and infections lead to bronchiectasis, pancreatic dysfunction  and early death or need for lung/liver/pancreas transplantation. CF-related insulin dependent diabetes occurs in nearly 50% of patients surviving to age 50. Male sterility is common. Individuals with milder phenotypes may have mild or absent respiratory symptoms in childhood, but some may have infertility or may develop bronchiectasis or pancreatitis later in life. 5% to 10% of patients with CF develop multilobular cirrhosis during the first decade of life.    Treatment is transitioning from addressing symptoms to correcting the underlying defects. The oldest therapies include bronchial drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics for increasingly resistant pathogens. Pancreatic enzyme replacement, vitamins and calorie supplements improve digestion and nutrition. New CFTR modulators may significantly restore partial chloride channel function in about 90% of patients but are mostly mutation specific and do not treat absent, truncated or severely malformed proteins. Immunization with routine immunizations along with pneumococcal vaccines and annual influenza vaccines is important. Synagis is also used to prevent RSV infection. Treatment is best initiated and managed by consultation with CF experts.

Pathogenic variants in this gene can also cause autosomal dominant Noctural Frontal Lobe Epilepsy 5, another neurologic disorder with later age of onset. The KCNT1 gene encodes a sodium-activated potassium channel widely expressed in the nervous system.  EIEE/DEE14 is a severe neurologic disorder characterized by onset in the first 6 months of life of refractory focal seizures and arrest of psychomotor development. The disorder presents as 'malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy' (MMPSI), a clinical designation.  MMPSI is a severe form of epilepsy that begins very early in life with partial or focal seizures commonly starting before age 6 months and often within a few weeks of birth. Seizure activity can be multifocal or can migrate from one region to another during an episode. The seizures do not respond well to treatment. Although affected individuals may develop normally at first, progression stalls and skills decline when seizures begin; as a result, affected individuals have profound developmental delay. Depending on the region affected, seizures can involve facial flushing, drooling, apnea,  movement of the head or eyes to one side, twitches in the eyelids or tongue, chewing motions or jerking of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. These may progress to loss of consciousness, muscle stiffening and tonic-clonic seizures. Initially, the seizures associated with MMPSI are relatively infrequent, occurring every few weeks. Within a few months of the seizures starting, though, the frequency increases. Affected individuals can have clusters of five to 30 seizures several times a day. Each seizure typically lasts seconds to a couple of minutes.  Status epilepticus has been reported with almost continuous seizure activity for several days in some cases. After a year or more of persistent seizures, the episodes become less frequent. Seizures can affect growth of the brain and lead to microcephaly. The problems with brain development can also cause profound developmental delay and intellectual impairment. Affected babies often lose the mental and motor skills they developed after birth, such as the ability to make eye contact and control their head movement. Many have hypotonia and become \"floppy.\" If seizures can be controlled for a short period, development may improve. Some affected children learn to reach for objects or walk. However, most children with this condition do not develop language skills. Because of the serious health problems caused by MMPSI, many affected individuals do not survive past infancy or early childhood. MMPSI is a rare condition. Although its prevalence is unknown, approximately 100 cases have been described in the medical literature. De novo gain of function mutations in KCNT1 are the most common known cause of MMPSI.

Recurrent seizures begin before the age of 6 months but commonly start within a few weeks of birth. The seizures do not respond well to treatment. Although affected individuals may develop normally at first, progression stalls and skills decline when seizures begin; as a result, affected individuals have profound developmental delay.The seizures in MMPSI are described as partial (or focal) because the seizure activity occurs in regions of the brain rather than affecting the entire brain. Seizure activity can appear in multiple locations in the brain or move (migrate) from one region to another during an episode. Depending on the region affected, seizures can involve sudden redness and warmth (flushing) of the face; drooling; short pauses in breathing (apnea); movement of the head or eyes to one side; twitches in the eyelids or tongue; chewing motions; or jerking of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. If seizure activity spreads to affect the entire brain, it causes a loss of consciousness, muscle stiffening, and rhythmic jerking (tonic-clonic seizure). Episodes that begin as partial seizures and spread throughout the brain are known as secondarily generalized seizures.Initially, the seizures associated with MMPSI are relatively infrequent, occurring every few weeks. Within a few months of the seizures starting, though, the frequency increases. Affected individuals can have clusters of five to 30 seizures several times a day. Each seizure typically lasts seconds to a couple of minutes, but they can be prolonged (classified as status epilepticus). In some cases, the seizure activity may be almost continuous for several days. After a year or more of persistent seizures, the episodes become less frequent.Seizures can affect growth of the brain and lead to a small head size (microcephaly). The problems with brain development can also cause profound developmental delay and intellectual impairment.

This gene provides instructions for making a mitochondrial matrix protein that is peripherally associated with the inner membrane. It is involved in the production of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). CoQ10 plays an essential role in oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. It is also involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. In cell membranes, CoQ10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. COQ8B expression and function is particularly important in podocytes.  Mutations in COQ8B cause steroid\u2010resistant nephrotic syndrome with variable neurological, ocular and cardiac involvement. The latter are generally mild and occur in a minority of patients.  Compared to other CoQ10 biosynthesis defects, mutations in COQ8B result in a less severe clinical phenotype, with more prominent kidney involvement, later age at onset of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome and good patient survival owing to the lack of extrarenal  manifestations. Humans have two paralog genes: COQ8A and COQ8B. How these genes interact with each other is still an area of active research. Both have been associated with primary CoQ10 deficiency. Notably mutations in COQ8A cause cerebellar ataxia and encephalopathy, while those in COQ8B cause steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. It is thought that COQ8A may partially compensate for absent COQ8B activity (and vice versa) since CoQ10 biosynthesis is not completely absent in patients with two null COQ8B alleles. It may also be that the \"mild\" phenotype seen in patients with COQ8B mutations is related to its modulatory function as the protein has no catalytic activity.  The onset of  symptoms has been described as typically occurring between 10 to 20 years of life, although earlier onset has been reported. Some cases have been identified by childhood screening for proteinuria.  The majority of patients progress to ESRD in the second decade of life. Treatment with CoQ10 has been shown to be beneficial: published long-term follow-up results (PMID 28337616) observed a maximum reduction of proteinuria after 6 months of treatment. Half of these patients were also treated with ACE inhibitors, which may also have contributed to the decrease in proteinuria. Notably, therapy in all reported cases was started after proteinuria developed.  If there is progression to end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation is effective without recurrence.   The exact prevalence of nephrotic disease caused by variants in COQ8B is not known; however, it seems to be diagnosed more frequently in individuals of Asian descent. A review published in 2020  (PMID 33305107) documented 87 cases in 47 families.  ", "Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a disorder that can affect many parts of the body, especially the brain, muscles, and kidneys. As its name suggests, the disorder involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10.The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency vary widely. In the most severe cases, the condition becomes apparent in infancy and causes severe brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and the failure of other body systems. These problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency can begin as late as a person's sixties and often cause cerebellar ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movement (cerebellum). Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency include seizures, intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), vision loss caused by degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves or breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and sensorineural hearing loss (which is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). The neurological problems gradually get worse unless treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation.A type of kidney dysfunction called nephrotic syndrome is another common feature of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It can occur with or without neurological abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when damage to the kidneys impairs their function, which allows protein from the blood to pass into the urine (proteinuria). Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include increased cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema).

The CHAT gene provides instructions for making choline acetyltransferase, an enzyme that is localized to the presynaptic terminals of nerve cells and facilitates the production of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is essential for normal muscle movement. When acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic terminal, it binds to a receptor protein located in the membrane of muscle cells, opening channels within the receptor and allowing for ions to flow in and out of muscle cells. The flow of these ions allows for muscle contraction and relaxation, resulting in muscle movement.  More than 30 mutations in the CHAT gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. The mutations lead to decreased production of choline acetyltransferase or the production of a protein with decreased ability to aid in the production of acetylcholine. The resulting lack of acetylcholine decreases the availability of open receptors, impairing ion flow through muscle cells. A reduction in muscle cell ion flow decreases muscle movement leading to muscle weakness characteristic of congenital myasthenic syndrome. Individuals with congenital myasthenic syndrome who have mutations in the CHAT gene are more likely than affected individuals with mutations in other genes to have apnea, although the cause for this association is unclear.

The DOCK8 gene provides instructions for making a member of the DOCK family of proteins. These proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GEFs activate GTPases, which are important for intracellular signaling. Signaling stimulated by DOCK family proteins is typically involved in arrangement of the cytoskeleton.  By controlling the shape of the cytoskeleton, DOCK family proteins play a role in cell structure and migration. DOCK8 is most abundant in immune cells, including T cells, NK cells and B cells. Through its function as a GEF, the DOCK8 protein helps maintain the structure and integrity of T cells and NK cells as well as aiding in the movement of cells to sites of infection, particularly the skin. The DOCK8 protein is also involved in B cell maturation. DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is characterized by abnormally high levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood; the levels can be more than 10 times higher than normal for no known reason. IgE normally triggers an immune response, particularly against parasitic worms, and plays a role in allergies. It is unclear why people with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome have such high levels of this protein. People with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome also have hypereosinophilia. Although DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is commonly called autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome, it is a distinct disorder from autosomal dominant IgE syndrome (caused by variants in STAT3).  DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is characterized by severe and often-life threatening recurrent bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Onset of symptoms is in infancy and death may occur early due to infection.  Cryptosporidial parasitic infections have also been reported. Skin infections cause rashes, blisters, abscesses, open sores, and scaling. Frequent bouts of pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections are also common. Other immune system-related problems in individuals with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome include eczema (atopic dermatitis), food or environmental allergies, and asthma. Some affected patients experience neurological problems such as hemiplegia. Blockage of blood flow in the brain or abnormal bleeding in the brain, both of which can lead to stroke, can also occur. Individuals with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome have a greater-than-average risk of developing cancer, particularly cancers of the blood or skin.   Aggressive treatment of acute infections is critical. Prophylaxis against bacterial, viral, fungal and cryptosporidium infections is important prior to definitive treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. INF-alpha 2b has been shown to be effective against viral infection, possibly by inhibiting viral replication and activating effector lymphocytes.  Dramatic improvement of viral infection has been reported in 3 published cases, but side effects are significant and careful monitoring is necessary. Although IgG levels may be normal, immunoglobulin prophylaxis is recommended due to impaired long-lived antibody responses. Patients should  be evaluated for underlying atopic disease. Nutrition should be monitored as food allergies may lead to malnutrition. Aggressive management of atopic dermatitis is critical to maintaining a protective skin barrier and minimizing viral and bacterial superinfection.  DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is a rare disorder whose prevalence is unknown.

AdoCbl is required for the normal function of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a mitochondrial enzyme needed for catabolism of methionine, threonine, isoleucine, valine, lipids and cholesterol. This enzyme may also function to deliver AdoCbl to methylmalonyl CoA mutase.  At least 25 mutations in the MMAB gene have been found to cause methylmalonic acidemia, a condition characterized by feeding difficulties, developmental delay, and long-term health problems. Mutations in this gene are thought to result in production of a nonfunctional enzyme. This loss of function results in a deficiency of AdoCbl, which subsequently impairs the function of methylmalonyl CoA mutase. Lack of methymalonyl-CoA mutase activity results in accumulation of toxic intermediates of amino acid and lipid metabolism due to a defect in conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA.

The CHRNA1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the acetylcholine receptor-AChR (AChR consists of 5 subunits- 2 alpha, 1 beta, 1 gamma and 1 delta). The AChR controls electrical signaling between nerve and muscle cells by opening and closing a gated membrane-spanning pore: binding of acetylcholine to this receptor results in conformational changes in all of the pore subunits, leading to opening of an ion-conduction channel across the plasma membrane. Genotype-phenotype correlations are difficult to ascertain in the rare CMS subtypes. Variants in CHRNA1 are reported to cause <1% of all congenital myasthenic syndromes. Gain-of-function variants , which alter the kinetic properties of the AChR, result in the autosomal dominant forms of slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome. CMS1A is a slow-channel myasthenic syndrome, caused by kinetic abnormalities of the AChR that result in prolonged AChR channel opening, prolonged endplate currents, and depolarization block. It also results in calcium overload, which may ultimately contribute to degeneration of the endplate and postsynaptic membrane.  CMS1A is one of many congenital myasthenic syndromes. Congenital myasthenic syndromes are characterized by muscle weakness affecting several muscle systems.  Axial and limb muscles are affected and hypotonia is seen in the early-onset forms.

The symptoms tend to fluctuate and worsen with physical effort. CMS1A has a variable age of onset: while weakness may be present in infancy or childhood, most adults are symptomatic. Exacerbation of symptoms is often seen during or after pregnancy. This is a progressive disorder related to development of secondary myopathy.  Treatment of CMS1A differs significantly from that of CMS1B (Myasthenic syndrome, congenital, 1B, fast-channel), which is also caused by variants in the CHRNA1 gene.

Variants in this gene can also cause the autosomal recessive condition Multiple pterygium syndrome, lethal type  and the autosomal dominant condition Myasthenic syndrome, congenital, 1A, slow-channel. The CHRNA1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the acetylcholine receptor-AChR (AChR consists of 5 subunits- 2 alpha, 1 beta, 1 gamma and 1 delta). The AChR controls electrical signaling between nerve and muscle cells by opening and closing a gated membrane-spanning pore: binding of acetylcholine to this receptor results in conformational changes in all of the pore subunits, leading to opening of an ion-conduction channel across the plasma membrane. Genotype-phenotype correlations are difficult to ascertain in the rare CMS subtypes. Variants in CHRNA1 are reported to cause <1% of all congenital myasthenic syndromes.

The LYST gene encodes a protein known as the lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein is thought to play a role in the transport of materials to the lysosome via endosomes. Evidence suggests that this protein may help determine the size of lysosomes and regulate lysosome movement within cells.   Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a condition of neonatal, infantile or childhood onset that affects many parts of the body, particularly the immune system. This disease damages immune system cells, leaving them less able to fight off invaders such as viruses and bacteria. As a result, most people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections starting in infancy or early childhood. These infections tend to be very serious or life-threatening. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is also characterized by a condition called oculocutaneous albinism, which causes abnormally light pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have fair skin and light-colored hair, often with a metallic sheen. Oculocutaneous albinism also causes vision problems such as reduced sharpness, nystagmus and photophobia. Many individuals with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have coagulation problems that lead to easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. In adulthood, Chediak-Higashi syndrome can also affect the nervous system, causing weakness, clumsiness, difficulty with walking, and seizures. If the disease is not successfully treated, most children with Chediak-Higashi syndrome reach a stage of the disorder known as the accelerated phase. This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by a viral infection. In the accelerated phase, white blood cells (which normally help fight infection) divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections, and organ failure. These medical problems are usually life-threatening in childhood. A small percentage of people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have a milder form of the condition that appears later in life. People with the adult form of the disorder have less noticeable changes in pigmentation and are less likely to have recurrent, severe infections. They do, however, have a significant risk of progressive neurological problems such as tremors, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and a decline in intellectual functioning.  There is no specific treatment for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Bone marrow transplants performed early in the disease appear to have been successful in several patients.

As its name suggests, the disorder involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10.The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency vary widely. In the most severe cases, the condition becomes apparent in infancy and causes severe brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and the failure of other body systems. These problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency can begin as late as a person's sixties and often cause cerebellar ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movement (cerebellum). Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency include seizures, intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), vision loss caused by degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves or breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and sensorineural hearing loss (which is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). The neurological problems gradually get worse unless treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation.A type of kidney dysfunction called nephrotic syndrome is another common feature of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It can occur with or without neurological abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when damage to the kidneys impairs their function, which allows protein from the blood to pass into the urine (proteinuria). Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include increased cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema). Affected individuals may also have blood in the urine (hematuria), which can lead to a reduced number of red blood cells in the body (anemia), abnormal blood clotting, or reduced amounts of certain white blood cells. Low white blood cell counts can lead to a weakened immune system and frequent infections in people with nephrotic syndrome.

This gene encodes a protein that has a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain.  TTC7A has been shown to act as a scaffolding protein: it binds and recruits phosphatidyl inositol 4 phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha to the plasma membrane and facilitates the synthesis of PI4-phosphate. There is evidence that there is some genotype/phenotype correlation in that patients with immunodeficiency and variants affecting the scaffolding TPR domains have a worse prognosis. Variants that results in protein truncation and loss of function tend to cause more severe intestinal phenotypes.  As with many genetic conditions, as more cases are identified, mounting evidence has accumulated that mutations in TTC7A can result in various phenotypes that may or may not be associated with combined immunodeficiency. Patients show heterogeneous intestinal and immunologic disease manifestations, including multiple intestinal atresias, very early onset inflammatory bowel disease, loss of intestinal architecture, apoptotic enterocolitis, combined immunodeficiency, and various extraintestinal features related to the skin and/or hair. Multiple intestinal atresia is usually characterized by the presence of numerous atretic segments in the small bowel or large bowel that result in the symptoms of intestinal obstruction: vomiting, abdominal bloating and inability to pass meconium in newborns. Historically, most cases have presented in the neonatal period with death during infancy or early childhood: TTC7A deficiency is fatal in approximately two thirds of patients.   Treatment has included surgical intervention for the intestinal atresias, provision of total parenteral nutrition, aggressive treatment of infection with broad spectrum IV antibiotics, prophylactic IV antibiotics (pentamidine, TMP/SMX) and IVIG. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been reported to recover immunologic defects; however, the intestinal disease is refractory to HSCT. Intestinal manifestations have been treated with liver-small bowel transplantation. Care should be used to use only irradiated and CMV negative blood products for transfusion, if needed.   Since 2013, there have been more than 50 TTC7A cases reported in the literature, and, unfortunately, more than half of these children died of the disease, with a median survival age of younger than 12 months.

Of those requiring kidney transplantation, there have been no cases of recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Early oral supplementation with high doses of CoQ10 can stop the progression of the kidney, central nervous system and muscular symptoms, although sensorineural hearing loss does not respond well to treatment.  Prevalence and incidence of COQ6 deficiency is not known.  ", "Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a disorder that can affect many parts of the body, especially the brain, muscles, and kidneys. As its name suggests, the disorder involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10.The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency vary widely. In the most severe cases, the condition becomes apparent in infancy and causes severe brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and the failure of other body systems. These problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency can begin as late as a person's sixties and often cause cerebellar ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movement (cerebellum). Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency include seizures, intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), vision loss caused by degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves or breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and sensorineural hearing loss (which is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). The neurological problems gradually get worse unless treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation.A type of kidney dysfunction called nephrotic syndrome is another common feature of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It can occur with or without neurological abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when damage to the kidneys impairs their function, which allows protein from the blood to pass into the urine (proteinuria). Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include increased cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema). Affected individuals may also have blood in the urine (hematuria), which can lead to a reduced number of red blood cells in the body (anemia), abnormal blood clotting, or reduced amounts of certain white blood cells. Low white blood cell counts can lead to a weakened immune system and frequent infections in people with nephrotic syndrome. If not treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation, affected individuals eventually develop irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).A type of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can also occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency."], "alternate_names": ["COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 6"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 20233.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "COQ6"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Ubidecarenone"}, {"int_description_2": "Kidney transplantation", "timeframe_int2": "Days or Weeks,Years", "age_use_int2": "Infant,Child", "contra_int2": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug2": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug2": "Effective / Ameliorative"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Primary coenzyme Q10 Deficiency-6 (COQ10D6): Two siblings with variable expressivity of the renal phenotype.", "pmid_1": 30682496.0, "pmid_date_1": 2020.0, "pmid_journal_1": "European journal of medical genetics"}, {"pmid_title_2": "CoQ10-related sustained remission of proteinuria in a child with COQ6 glomerulopathy-a case report.", "pmid_2": 30232548.0, "pmid_date_2": 2018.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Further phenotypic heterogeneity of CoQ10 deficiency associated with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome and novel COQ2 and COQ6 variants.", "pmid_3": 28044327.0, "pmid_date_3": 2017.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Clinical genetics"}, {"pmid_title_4": "COQ6 Mutations in Children With Steroid-Resistant Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis and Sensorineural Hearing Loss.", "pmid_4": 28117207.0, "pmid_date_4": 2017.0, "pmid_journal_4": "American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation"}, {"pmid_title_5": "COQ6 mutations in human patients produce nephrotic syndrome with sensorineural deafness.", "pmid_5": 21540551.0, "pmid_date_5": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_5": "The Journal of clinical investigation"}]}, {"_id": "2025-OMIM:166600", "condition": {"condition_name": "OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2; OPTA2", "freq_per_birth": "Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis is the most common form of the disorder, affecting about 1 in 20,000 people.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase family, which interacts with BRCT repeats on BRCA1. It is a DNA-dependent ATPase and 5'to3' DNA helicase required for chromosomal stability. It acts late in the FA pathway, after FANCCD2 ubiquination and is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks by homologous recombination that depends on its interaction with BRCA1.   FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.    Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. Variants in BRIP1 cause approximately 2% of all cases of FA.

FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. FANCL encodes a ubiquitine ligase that is a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group, a core complex composed of eight FA proteins plus two Fanconi anemia-associated proteins (FAAPs). These proteins are involved in a cellular process known as the FA pathway: this pathway is activated when DNA replication is blocked due to DNA damage, particularly interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). ICLs form when nucleotides on opposite strands of DNA are abnormally attached or linked together interrupting DNA replication. ICLs are caused by exposure to endogenous or exogenous mutagens (e.g., cancer therapy drugs). The FA core complex activates two other proteins, FANCD2 and FANCI, by monoubiquitination. This activation results in the formation of the ID complex which acts to attract DNA repair proteins to the area of DNA damage so the error can be corrected, and DNA replication can continue. Mutations in the FANCL gene lead to a nonfunctional FA core complex, which disrupts the entire FA pathway. As a result, DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and ICLs build up over time. The ICLs stall DNA replication, ultimately resulting in either abnormal cell death due to an inability to make new DNA molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of DNA repair processes. Cells that divide quickly, such as bone marrow cells and cells of the developing fetus, are particularly affected. The death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical abnormalities characteristic of Fanconi anemia. When the buildup of errors in DNA leads to uncontrolled cell growth, affected individuals can develop leukemia or other cancers.  FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. Mutations in FANCL are a very rare cause of FA anemia, causing <1% of cases.

The LHX4 protein is a transcription factor required for pituitary development.  Deficiency of this protein results in combined pituitary hormone deficiency along with congenital defects in the cerebellum and sella turcica.   Combined pituitary hormone deficiency 4 is characterized by complete or partial deficiencies of growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Clinical features include short stature, cerebellar defects, small sella turcica and hypoplastic anterior hypophysis associated with pointed cerebellar tonsils. If untreated, deficiencies of growth hormone result in very short stature, beginning in infancy or childhood; deficiencies of the other hormones cause hypothyroidism and delayed or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics and infertility.  The prevalence of combined pituitary hormone deficiency is estimated to be 1 in 8,000 individuals worldwide. Mutations in at least eight genes have been found to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency.

Hypothyroidism can cause many symptoms, including weight gain and fatigue. Other features of combined pituitary hormone deficiency include delayed or absent puberty and lack the ability to have biological children (infertility). The condition can also be associated with a deficiency of the hormone cortisol.

Pathogenic variants in COLQ result in a deficiency of acetylcholinesterase. Since acetylcholinesterase rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine that is released at cholinergic synapses, deficiency of this enzyme affects the duration of the synaptic response, ultimately resulting in prolonged synaptic currents and action potentials related to extended residence of acetylcholine in the synaptic space.

However, any of the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) can be affected in this condition. Due to muscle weakness, affected infants may have feeding difficulties. Development of motor skills such as crawling or walking may be delayed. The severity of the myasthenia varies greatly, with some people experiencing minor weakness and others having such severe weakness that they are unable to walk.Some individuals have episodes of breathing problems that may be triggered by fevers or infection.

LMBRD1 encodes a protein (LMBD1) that is involved in the conversion of cobalamin (vitamin B12) into adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is a cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, while MeCbl is a cofactor for methionine synthase. The LMBD1 protein is found in the membranes of lysosomes. This protein interacts with the ABCD4 protein. These proteins act together to transport B12 out of lysosomes, making it available for processing into AdoCbl and MeCbl. LMBD1 may also be found in the plasma membrane where it appears to be involved in recycling of the insulin receptor, thus regulating insulin signaling. (Parenthetically, an isoform of LMBD1, called NESI, interacts with the nuclear export signal of a protein that forms a piece of the hepatitis D virus. It is thought that interaction with NESI aids in the assembly of the virus. The hepatitis D virus can cause liver disease, although infection is rare and requires co-infection with hepatitis B virus.) Lack of LMBD1 prevents the release of vitamin B12 from lysosomes, so the vitamin is unavailable for the production of AdoCbl and MeCbl.

Individuals with this disorder have a combination of features from two separate conditions, methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria. The signs and symptoms of the combined condition, methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, usually develop in infancy, although they can begin at any age.When the condition begins early in life, affected individuals typically have an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), which is sometimes recognized before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). These infants can also have difficulty feeding and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor). Neurological problems are also common in methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, including weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and seizures. Most infants and children with this condition have an unusually small head size (microcephaly), delayed development, and intellectual disability. Less common features of the condition include eye problems and a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than normal (megaloblastic). The signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria worsen over time, and the condition can be life-threatening if not treated.When methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria begins in adolescence or adulthood, the signs and symptoms usually include psychiatric changes and cognitive problems.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions in exocytosis of cytolytic granules from T- and NK cells by transporting granules to target cell membranes. These proteins then enter the target cell and trigger cytolysis. It has also been implicated in regulation of the immune system by destroying unneeded T cells. This prevents overproduction of cytokines which, in excess, can cause inflammation and tissue damage.  More than 50 UNC13D gene mutations have been identified in patients with familial HLH. Most of these mutations result in production of a dysfunctional protein. The resulting shortage of functional UNC13D protein interferes with its role in cell destruction and immune system regulation, leading to the exaggerated immune response characteristic of familial HLH.  Familial HLH is a disorder in which the immune system produces too many activated T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and macrophages, resulting in excessive production of cytokines. Overactivation of the immune system causes fever and damages the liver and spleen, resulting in organ enlargement. Familial HLH also destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, a process called hemophagocytosis. As a result, affected individuals have anemia and thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia may cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. The brain may also be affected in familial HLH. As a result, affected individuals may experience irritability, delayed closure of the bones of the skull in infants, neck stiffness, abnormal muscle tone, impaired muscle coordination, paralysis, blindness, seizures, and coma. In addition to neurological problems, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can cause abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing leukemia and lymphoma. Signs and symptoms of familial HLH usually become apparent during infancy, although occasionally they appear later in life. They usually occur when the immune system launches an exaggerated response to an infection but may also occur in the absence of infection. All forms of HLH, including adequately treated cases, may have a high mortality rate. The prognosis of familial forms without treatment is poor, with a median survival of less than 2 months to 6 months after diagnosis. Even with treatment, only 21-26% survive 5 years. The course of the disease and life expectancy are not well studied in adults with familial HLH.  Immunosuppressants are administered to suppress the overactivation of the immune system to prevent side effects caused by secreted cytokines. Since this increases the frequency of various opportunistic infections, prophylactic antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral agents are given. If control is not achieved by immunosuppressive therapy alone, a cytotoxic anticancer drug capable of removing excessively proliferated T cells and NK cells  is  added. Currently, the treatment regimen, HLH-2004 therapy is used and is a modified/complementary therapy built on the results of the HLH-94 therapy. In case of disease that is refractory to treatment or reactivates, there is still no effective salvage therapy that can be performed prior to proceeding to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is essential and curative.  After allogeneic HSCT, the long-term survival rate for pediatric cases of HLH has been reported to be approximately 22-59%. Although not currently standard of care, case studies reporting results of trials of rituximab, infliximab or rixolitinib suggest that these may be effective and safe therapeutic options for the treatment of refractory/relapsed HLH.  Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide. While the prevalence of Familial HLH caused by variants in UNC13D is not known, one report found that 27/476 pediatric patients  with familial HLH (5.7%) had variants in UNC13D. Of these patients, 20/27 (74%)  presented before the age of one.   ", "Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a disorder in which the immune system produces too many activated immune cells (lymphocytes) called T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and macrophages (histiocytes).

This overactivation of the immune system causes fever and damages the liver and spleen, resulting in enlargement of these organs.Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, a process called hemophagocytosis. As a result, affected individuals have low numbers of red blood cells (anemia) and a reduction in the number of platelets, which are involved in clotting. A reduction in platelets may cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.The brain may also be affected in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. As a result, affected individuals may experience irritability, delayed closure of the bones of the skull in infants, neck stiffness, abnormal muscle tone, impaired muscle coordination, paralysis, blindness, seizures, and coma. In addition to neurological problems, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can cause abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues.

FERMT3, also known as KINDLIN3, encodes an intracellular protein that interacts with beta-integrins, specifically in hematopoietic cells. Deficiency of this protein disrupts the adhesive functions of integrins on both leukocytes and platelets. This is thought to be due to defects in activation-dependent changes of surface integrins that facilitate high-avidity ligand binding to target cells (inside-out signaling).   The first signs occur in infancy or early childhood with bleeding and life-threatening bacterial or fungal infections. Lack of pus-formation is observed in areas of infection.  Bleeding symptoms may start at birth with moderate mucocutaneous bleeding (petechiae, buccal hemorrhage, epistaxis). Mucocutaneous bleeding is a hallmark of the disease and bleeding episodes may be quite severe. Intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported in 15% of cases, while pulmonary bleeding has been reported in 6% of cases. Notably, 32% of patients also had osteopetrosis, which can complicate treatment as it may affect hematopoietic stem cell transplant engraftment. Management of complications can be challenging; there are several reports of deaths related to bleeding complications.   Management focuses on controlling infections and includes symptomatic treatment with antibiotics and blood transfusions, as well as antimicrobial prophylaxis (usually with TMP/SMX and itraconazole) and provision of IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia. Frequent red blood cell and platelet transfusions are often necessary for treatment of bleeding events. Recombinant Factor VIIa, which is often used to treat Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which LAD3 resembles, has been used successfully as a first-line treatment for severe bleeding as well as a preventative treatment in high-risk situations, although its use is considered off-label.  Bone marrow transplantation, which should be done early in infancy,  is the only available curative treatment option. Prognosis is poor and death occurs in early infancy if bone marrow transplantation is not performed.  This is a very rare disorder. The exact prevalence and incidence are not known.

It may occur more frequently in northern European countries, such as Sweden, and in the United Kingdom. Another form of the disorder, hereditary coproporphyria, has been reported mostly in Europe and North America.

Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is a component of several iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).Researchers have identified several types of porphyria, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and their signs and symptoms. Some types of porphyria, called cutaneous porphyrias, primarily affect the skin. Areas of skin exposed to the sun become fragile and blistered, which can lead to infection, scarring, changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), and increased hair growth. Cutaneous porphyrias include congenital erythropoietic porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and porphyria cutanea tarda.Other types of porphyria, called acute porphyrias, primarily affect the nervous system. These disorders are described as acute because their signs and symptoms appear quickly and usually last a short time.  Episodes of acute porphyria can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea.  During an episode, a person may also experience muscle weakness, seizures, fever, and mental changes such as anxiety and hallucinations. These signs and symptoms can be life-threatening, especially if the muscles that control breathing become paralyzed. Acute porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria and ALAD deficiency porphyria. Two other forms of porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria, can have both acute and cutaneous symptoms.The porphyrias can also be split into erythropoietic and hepatic types, depending on where damaging compounds called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors first build up in the body. In erythropoietic porphyrias, these compounds originate in the bone marrow. Erythropoietic porphyrias include erythropoietic protoporphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Health problems associated with erythropoietic porphyrias include a low number of red blood cells (anemia) and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). The other types of porphyrias are considered hepatic porphyrias. In these disorders, porphyrins and porphyrin precursors originate primarily in the liver, leading to abnormal liver function and an increased risk of developing liver cancer.Environmental factors can strongly influence the occurrence and severity of signs and symptoms of porphyria. Alcohol, smoking, certain drugs, hormones, other illnesses, stress, and dieting or periods without food (fasting) can all trigger the signs and symptoms of some forms of the disorder.

The CPT1A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, which is found in the liver. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that metabolizes fats and converts them into energy. Fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. A group of fats called long-chain fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria unless they are attached to carnitine. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A connects carnitine to long-chain fatty acids so they can enter mitochondria and be used to produce energy. During periods of fasting, long-chain fatty acids are an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.  Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from using certain fats for energy, particularly during periods fasting. The severity of this condition varies among affected individuals.  Signs and symptoms of CPT I deficiency often appear during early childhood. Affected individuals usually have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and a low level of ketones, which are produced during the breakdown of fats and used for energy. Together these signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia. People with CPT I deficiency can also have an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), liver malfunction, and elevated levels of carnitine in the blood. Carnitine, a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is used by cells to process fats and produce energy. Individuals with CPT I deficiency are at risk for nervous system damage, liver failure, seizures, coma, and sudden death. Problems related to CPT I deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.  Treatment of CPT1 deficiency revolves around preventing episodes of hypoglycemia. Infants should eat frequently during the day and night. Frequent feeding is recommended, particularly for infants, given their limited glycogen reserves. Cornstarch feedings given overnight provide a constant source of slow-release carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycemia during sleep. Older children should not fast for more than 12 hours and for a shorter time if evidence of a febrile or gastrointestinal illness exists. Adults need a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet to provide a constant supply of carbohydrate energy and medium-chain triglycerides to provide approximately one third of total calories (C6-C10 fatty acids do not require the carnitine shuttle for entry into the mitochondrion).  Prompt treatment with intravenous fluid containing 10% dextrose during periods of prolonged fasting, illness or catabolic stress to prevent hypoglycemia is important. The infusion should be maintained past the time that the blood glucose concentration has normalized in order to replete hepatic glycogen stores.    With treatment, episodes of hypoglycemia, and consequent neurologic injury, may be avoided. Without treatment, injury from hypoglycemic episodes may lead to developmental delay, seizures, coma, and death. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy may occur in a heterozygous mother of a homozygous fetus.  CPT I deficiency is a rare disorder; fewer than 50 affected individuals have been identified, with an estimated prevalence of 1:500,000- 1:1,000,000 newborns in the general population. This disorder may be more common in the Hutterite (carrier frequency 1:16) and Inuit (1.3:1,000 live births) populations.

SLX4 encodes a multidomain scaffold protein that interacts with 3 distinct nucleases (SLX1, ERCC4/XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1). Interaction with the latter two nucleases in important for processing of interstrand crosslinks while interaction with the former is important for resolution of Holliday junctions.  Aberrant function of SLX4 results in abnormal assembly and function of the endonucleases and loss of DNA repair function.  FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.    Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans.

The MMACHC gene encodes a protein that plays an integral role in the conversion of cobalamin (vitamin B12) into either adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, an enzyme that functions in the catabolism of lipids, cholesterol and the branched chain amino acids isoleucine and valine while MeCbl is a cofactor for the enzyme methionine synthase, required for the conversion of homocysteine into methionine. In addition to processing different forms of vitamin B12 for conversion into AdoCbl or MeCbl, the MMACHC protein also interacts with another protein, MMADHC. The two proteins work together to transport processed cobalamin into cellular compartments where the cofactor is needed:   AdoCbl to the  mitochondria and MeCbl to the cytoplasm. Pathogenic variants in this gene result in loss of function and deficiency of functional MMACHC which, in turn, prevents normal processing and transport of vitamin B12 and impaired production of both AdoCbl and MeCbl. The consequent deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase function, due to lack of these required cofactors, results in accumulation of toxic metabolites, methylmalonic acid (methylmalonic acidemia/aciduria) and homocysteine (homocysteinemia/homocystinuria), as well as decreased production of methionine (hypomethioninemia).    The disease typically presents with failure to thrive, acute neurological deterioration, intellectual deficits, lethargy, seizures, microcephaly, a salt-and-pepper retinopathy, and signs of megaloblastic anemia (pallor, fatigue, anorexia). Severe brain abnormalities including hydrocephalus, white matter abnormalities, cerebral atrophy, and unusual basal ganglia lesions are common. Onset of the disorder can be early (infantile) or late (juvenile or adult), with the late-onset form characterized by ataxia, dementia and psychosis.  The mainstay of treatment includes high-dose intramuscular hydroxycobalamin (OHCbl), which can lower serum MMA and homocysteine levels and increase serum methionine levels. Betaine can also be used to increase remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. There is little evidence supporting the use of dietary therapy for cblC deficiency. Despite early initiation of therapy and regardless of dietary management, overall outcomes remain poor (PMID: 28151490).    ", "Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to properly process protein building blocks (amino acids), certain fats (lipids), and a waxy fat-like substance called cholesterol. Individuals with this disorder have a combination of features from two separate conditions, methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria. The signs and symptoms of the combined condition, methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, usually develop in infancy, although they can begin at any age.When the condition begins early in life, affected individuals typically have an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), which is sometimes recognized before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). These infants can also have difficulty feeding and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor). Neurological problems are also common in methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, including weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and seizures. Most infants and children with this condition have an unusually small head size (microcephaly), delayed development, and intellectual disability. Less common features of the condition include eye problems and a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than normal (megaloblastic). The signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria worsen over time, and the condition can be life-threatening if not treated.When methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria begins in adolescence or adulthood, the signs and symptoms usually include psychiatric changes and cognitive problems. Affected individuals can exhibit changes in their behavior and personality; they may become less social and may experience hallucinations, delirium, and psychosis. In addition, these individuals can begin to lose previously acquired mental and movement abilities, resulting in a decline in school or work performance, difficulty controlling movements, memory problems, speech difficulties, a decline in intellectual function (dementia), or an extreme lack of energy (lethargy). Some people with methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria whose signs and symptoms begin later in life develop a condition called subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which leads to numbness and weakness in the lower limbs, difficulty walking, and frequent falls."], "alternate_names": ["METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA AND HOMOCYSTINURIA, cblC TYPE; MAHCC"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 24525.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "MMACHC"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Protein-restricted diet"}, {"int_description_2": "Hydroxocobalamin", "timeframe_int2": "Hours", "age_use_int2": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int2": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug2": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug2": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_3": "Metronidazole", "timeframe_int3": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int3": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int3": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug3": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug3": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_4": "Levocarnitine", "timeframe_int4": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int4": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int4": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug4": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug4": "Still in Trials / Unproven"}, {"int_description_5": "Leucovorin"}, {"int_description_6": "Glycine betaine"}, {"int_description_7": "Vatiquinone", "timeframe_int7": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int7": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int7": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug7": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug7": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_8": "Carglumic acid"}, {"int_description_9": "Kidney-liver transplantation"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Clinical presentation, gene analysis and outcomes in young patients with early-treated combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia (cblC type) in Shandong province, China.", "pmid_1": 26563984.0, "pmid_date_1": 2016.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Brain & development"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Neurologic and neurodevelopmental phenotypes in young children with early-treated combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cobalamin C type.", "pmid_2": 23954310.0, "pmid_date_2": 2013.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Molecular genetics and metabolism"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblC type.

dominant, Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Autosomal Recessive Severe Congenital Neutropenia 4 is a rare, autosomal recessive, primary immunodeficiency caused by variants in the G6PC3 gene located on chromosome 17q21.31. This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). G6Pase is located in the endoplasmic reticulum  and catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose and phosphate in the last step of the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways.  G6PC3 deficiency is highly variable in severity and clinical features. It is characterized by severe congenital neutropenia in a phenotypic continuum that ranges from nonsyndromic isolated severe congenital neutropenia to classic G6PC3 deficiency to severe G6PC3 deficiency.  Classic G6PC3 deficiency is also known as severe congenital neutropenia plus cardiovascular and/or urogenital abnormalities. Severe G6PC3 deficiency is also known as classic G6PC3 deficiency plus involvement of non-myeloid hematopoietic cell lines, additional extra-hematologic features, and pulmonary hypertension or Dursun syndrome.  This condition usually presents in the first few months of life with recurrent bacterial infections and neutropenia. Intrauterine growth restriction, failure to thrive, and poor postnatal growth are commonly described. Other findings in classic and severe G6PC3 deficiency can include inflammatory bowel disease resembling Crohn's disease, and endocrine disorders (growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and delayed puberty). Some patients may have seizures, heart anomalies or genital abnormalities. Some affected individuals develop a prominent ectatic superficial vein pattern that  may be less evident in infancy in some patients but tends to gradually become more prominent with age. In adults these vascular changes can develop into varicose veins and result in venous ulcers.  Around 20% of affected individuals develop myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia during adolescence. Around 40% of affected individuals have osteopenia which may progress to osteoporosis resulting in an increased  risk for bone fractures. Bone disorders can begin any time between infancy through adulthood.  Management of this condition often requires treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). If absolute neutrophil counts are maintained above 0.5x109/L , the number of infections is reduced, and quality of life is improved. Mildly affected individuals may be adequately managed with prophylactic antibiotics alone. Fevers and infections require prompt treatment with antibiotics. Routine management of congenital heart disease, renal and urinary tract malformations, and hormone deficiencies is performed as needed. Good dental hygiene after tooth eruption, including careful brushing, flossing and regular dental visits decreases the potential for infection. In those with uncorrected neutropenia undergoing dental procedures, especially those with heart defects, prophylactic antibiotics should be considered to decrease the risk for subacute bacterial endocarditis.   As of 2015, approximately 100 molecularly proven cases of G6PC3 deficiency have been reported. The prevalence varies from population to population due to founder effects and cultural practices (consanguinity). G6PC3 has been reported to be the most common cause of severe congenital neutropenia in Israel. The estimated incidence, as reported by the French Neutropenia Registry, is about 0.4 in 1,000,000 births.  ", "Severe congenital neutropenia is a condition that causes affected individuals to be prone to recurrent infections.  People with this condition have a shortage (deficiency) of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that plays a role in inflammation and in fighting infection. The deficiency of neutrophils, called neutropenia, is apparent at birth or soon afterward. It leads to recurrent infections beginning in infancy, including infections of the sinuses, lungs, and liver. Affected individuals can also develop fevers and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and skin. Approximately 40 percent of affected people have decreased bone density (osteopenia) and may develop osteoporosis, a condition that makes bones progressively more brittle and prone to fracture.  In people with severe congenital neutropenia, these bone disorders can begin at any time from infancy through adulthood.Approximately 20 percent of people with severe congenital neutropenia develop

FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer.  UBE2T encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to protein substrates. It is involved in mitomycin-C-induced DNA repair by associating with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase FANCL and catalyzing monoubiquitination of FACND2, which is required for DNA damage repair.  It also is involved in monoubiquination of FANCL and FANCI and may contribute to ubiquination and degradation of BRCA1.    FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. UBE2T mutation is a rare cause  of Fanconi Anemia, reported to cause <1% of FA cases.

The CTPS1 gene encodes an enzyme, cytidine-5-prime-triphosphate synthetase, that is responsible for the catalytic conversion of UTP (uridine triphosphate) to CTP (cytidine triphosphate), an important step in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and nucleic acids. Activity of this protein is important in the immune system: loss of function is associated with immunodeficiency 24.  Immunodeficiency 24 is characterized by an impaired capacity of activated T and B cells to proliferate in response to receptor-mediated activation. The enzyme is important in the sustained proliferation of activated lymphocytes during the immune response.  Affected individuals have a severe phenotype with early onset of severe chronic viral infections (mostly herpesviruses including Epstein-Barr and varicella zoster viruses) and recurrent infections caused by encapsulated bacteria. This condition is considered to be on the spectrum typical of a combined deficiency of adaptive immunity.  Treatment revolves around antimicrobial prophylaxis, particularly anti-viral and anti-bacterial prophylaxis and eventual hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  This is a very rare disorder. Incidence and prevalence are unknown. To date, fewer than 30 patients, many from the northwest region of England, have been reported in the literature.

Cobalamin(vitamin B12)  is an essential cofactor in several metabolic pathways. Intracellular conversion of cobalamin to adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) in mitochondria and to methylcobalamin (MeCbl) in cytoplasm is required for homeostasis of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. The MMADHC gene encodes a protein that is involved in the interconversion of cobalamin to AdoCbl and MeCbl.   Three different presentations have been described resulting from the absence of functional MMADHC: (1) the classic form with combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria cblD type; (2) cblD variant 1 (cblDv1) with isolated homocystinuria; and(3)  cblD variant 2 (cblDv2) with isolated methylmalonic aciduria. Clinical presentation is extremely variable. The disorder can present from early infancy to late childhood. Presenting signs are variable depending on which aspect(s) of cobalamin metabolism are affected and can include developmental delay, severe learning difficulties, seizures, movement and gait abnormalities, behavioral problems and signs of megaloblastic anemia (pallor, fatigue, anorexia). Prognosis is better in patients with later-onset disease.  .  At least seven mutations in the MMADHC gene cause cblD variant 1 (cblDv1) with isolated homocystinuria, which is characterized by skeletal problems and intellectual disability. The MMADHC gene mutations that cause homocystinuria result in a protein that cannot transport vitamin B12 to the cytoplasm, where MeCbl is produced. The resulting shortage of MeCbl impairs methionine synthase's conversion of homocysteine to methionine. As a result, homocysteine builds up in the bloodstream and methionine is depleted.  At least three mutations in the MMADHC gene have been found to cause cblD variant 2 (cblDv2) with isolated methylmalonic aciduria, a condition characterized by feeding difficulties, developmental delay, and long-term health problems. The MMADHC gene mutations that cause this condition result in a protein that cannot transport vitamin B12 to mitochondria for the production of AdoCbl. A lack of AdoCbl impairs the function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. As a result, certain proteins and lipids are not broken down properly. This defect allows toxic compounds to build up in the body's organs and tissues, causing the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia.  At least three MMADHC gene mutations can cause the classic form with combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria (methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, cblD type), that has features of both of the two previously described conditions. People with this combined condition have developmental delay, eye defects, neurological problems, and blood abnormalities. The MMADHC gene mutations that cause this condition result in the production of a protein that cannot transport vitamin B12 to either the mitochondria or the cytoplasm, which disrupts production of both AdoCbl and MeCbl. Because both cofactors are missing, the enzymes that require them (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase) do not function normally. As a result, certain amino acids (predominantly isoleucine and valine), lipids, and cholesterol are not broken down and homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. This dual defect results in a buildup of toxic compounds as well as homocysteine, and a decrease in the production of methionine within the body.   Patients are treated with intramuscular injections of hydroxycobalamin, oral betaine, and folic acid. Good metabolic control and correction of hematologic problems can sometimes be achieved with this treatment, but most patients continue to have signs of motor and language delay, intellectual deficit and abnormal ophthalmologic findings.   CblD is a rare disorder for which exact prevalence and incidence are not known.  ", "Homocystinuria is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to process certain building blocks of proteins (amino acids) properly. There are multiple forms of homocystinuria, which are distinguished by their signs and symptoms and genetic cause. The most common form of homocystinuria is characterized by nearsightedness (myopia), dislocation of the lens at the front of the eye, an increased risk of abnormal blood clotting, and brittle bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis) or other skeletal abnormalities. Some affected individuals also have developmental delay and learning problems.Less common forms of homocystinuria can cause intellectual disability, failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), seizures, problems with movement, and a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than normal (megaloblastic).The signs and symptoms of homocystinuria typically develop within the first year of life, although some mildly affected people may not develop features until later in childhood or adulthood."], "alternate_names": ["METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA AND HOMOCYSTINURIA, cblD TYPE; MAHCD"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 25221.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "MMADHC"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Protein-restricted diet"}, {"int_description_2": "Hydroxocobalamin"}, {"int_description_3": "Metronidazole", "age_use_int3": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int3": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug3": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug3": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_4": "Cyanocobalamin", "age_use_int4": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int4": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug4": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug4": "Still in Trials / Unproven"}, {"int_description_5": "Levocarnitine", "age_use_int5": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int5": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug5": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug5": "Still in Trials / Unproven"}, {"int_description_6": "Leucovorin"}, {"int_description_7": "Glycine betaine"}, {"int_description_8": "Carglumic acid"}, {"int_description_9": "Folic acid", "age_use_int9": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int9": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug9": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug9": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_10": "Kidney-liver transplantation"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Neutropenia and Increased Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) With Abnormal Neurologic Findings: A Case of Cobalamin D Deficiency.", "pmid_1": 29620684.0, "pmid_date_1": 2019.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology"}, {"pmid_title_2": "A Novel Two-Nucleotide Deletion of <i>MMADHC</i> Gene Causing cblD Disease in a Chinese Family.", "pmid_2": 30334532.0, "pmid_date_2": 2018.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Chinese medical journal"}, {"pmid_title_3": "The cblD defect causes either isolated or combined deficiency of methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin synthesis.", "pmid_3": 15292234.0, "pmid_date_3": 2004.0, "pmid_journal_3": "The Journal of biological chemistry"}]}, {"_id": "25223-OMIM:607426", "condition": {"condition_name": "COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 1", "freq_per_birth": "The prevalence of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is thought to be less than 1 in 100,000 people.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Primary Coenzyme Q10 deficiency 1 is an autosomal recessive condition caused by variants in the COQ2 gene located on chromosome 4q21.23. It is one of several disorders that result in Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency. The COQ2 gene provides instructions for making polyprenyltransferase, an enzyme that is involved in one step in the production of CoQ10. CoQ10 has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In mitochondria, CoQ10 plays an essential role in oxidative phosphorylation. CoQ10 is also involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Pyrimidines are required for synthesis of DNA, RNA, ATP and GTP. In cell membranes, CoQ10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals, which are byproducts of energy production.Primary CoQ10 deficiency is a disorder that can affect many parts of the body, especially the brain, muscles, and kidneys. As its name suggests, the disorder involves a deficiency of CoQ10.The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary CoQ10 deficiency vary widely although most cases have onset in infancy or early childhood. Deficiency causes encephalomyopathy but may also affect other body systems. These problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary CoQ10 deficiency are often identified because of onset of cerebellar ataxia. Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary CoQ10 deficiency include seizures, intellectual disability, hypotonia, dystonia, spasticity, nystagmus,  optic nerve atrophy or retinitis pigmentosa, and sensorineural hearing loss. These neurological problems are progressive without treatment with CoQ10 supplementation. Other complications of COQ2 deficiency can include liver failure, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulosclerosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, seizures, and/or cognitive impairment. Hypercholesterolemia, ascites and edema are seen with nephrotic syndrome. Hematuria may also be present. Anemia, abnormal blood clotting and pancytopenia are also clinical findings. Lactic acidemia and elevated creatine kinase are also seen.  Early treatment with high-dose oral CoQ10 supplementation can limit disease progression and reverse some manifestations. Established renal and/or severe neurological damage, however, cannot be reversed. Treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, retinopathy, and sensorineural hearing loss is per usual standard of care.

Variants in TSR2 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia with mandibulofacial dysostosis. The TSR2 gene is located at Xp11.22. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion. TSR2 is a negative regulator of NF-kappa-B and is also likely involved in pre-rRNA processing. The human ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 different proteins. The majority of Blackfan-Diamond anemia cases are associated with ribosomal genes.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide.

The CUBN gene provides instructions for making a protein called cubilin (intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor). This protein is involved in the uptake of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) from food into the body. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). The cubilin protein is primarily found associated with kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. Cubilin is anchored to the outer membrane of these cells by its attachment to another protein called amnionless (encoded by the AMN gene). Cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the small intestine and kidneys, including vitamin B12. During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin binds B12. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidneys, cubilin and amnionless are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.  Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome is a condition caused by low levels of vitamin B12. The primary feature of this condition is a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. In this form of anemia, which is a disorder characterized by the shortage of red blood cells, the red cells that are present are abnormally large. About half of people with Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome also have high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria). Although proteinuria can be an indication of kidney problems, people with Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome appear to have normal kidney function. Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome typically begins in infancy or early childhood. The blood abnormality leads to many of the signs and symptoms of the condition, including failure to thrive, pallor, fatigue, and recurring gastrointestinal or respiratory infections. Other features of Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome include mild neurological problems, such hypotonia, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, movement problems, delayed development, or confusion. Rarely, affected individuals have abnormalities of organs or tissues that make up the urinary tract, such as the bladder or the tubes that carry fluid from the kidneys to the bladder (the ureters).  IGS occurs worldwide, but its prevalence is higher in several Middle Eastern countries, Norway, and Finland. The prevalence of both forms of IGS in Finland and Norway at about 1 in 200,000.

FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. RFWD3 encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is required for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks in response to DNA damage. It plays a key role in Replication Protein A-mediated DNA damage signaling and repair. It ubiquinates the RPA complex and RAD51 that are stalled at replication forks and results in their removal and promotion of homologous recombination. It also plays a role in p53/TP53 ubiquination in response to ionizing radiation.  FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. Mutations in RFWD3 are a very rare cause of FA anemia. To date, one case has been reported in the literature.

FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. The FA pathway is complex: the FA core complex activates FANCD2 and FANCI by monoubiquitination. This activation results in the formation of the ID complex which acts to attract DNA repair proteins to the area of DNA damage so the error can be corrected, and DNA replication can continue. FANCI  plays an essential role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and in the repair of interstrand DNA cross-links by promoting FANCD2 monoubiquitination by FANCL and participating in recruitment to DNA repair sites. It is required for maintenance of chromosomal stability and specifically binds to both single-stranded and double-stranded branched DNA. It also participates in S phase and G2 phase checkpoint activation upon DNA damage.  FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. Mutations in FANCI cause approximately 1% of all FA cases.

The CXCR4 gene encodes a G-protein -coupled receptor for the chemokine CXCL12. CXCR4 is an essential multitasking receptor important in diverse aspects of development including normal immune function, as well as infectious, inflammatory and immunologically-mediated disease. WHIM syndrome is caused by increased signaling through the CXCR4 receptor which leads to myelokathexis- retention of mature myeloid cells in the bone marrow - resulting in severe peripheral leukopenia. The main clinical characteristics are warts from HPV infection, neutropenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. There is also an increased risk of cancer, especially HPV and EBV related malignancies. WHIM behaves as a relatively mild immunodeficiency. Affected individuals do not suffer from the severity and type of opportunistic infections compared to individuals with similarly low CD4+ T cell counts or neutropenia due to other acquired or inherited disorders with leukopenia. Age of presentation is variable from infancy to young adulthood. The mainstays of treatment for this condition have been granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IVIG but side effects limit their usefulness in some patients. Plerixafor, a CXCR4 receptor antagonist, has shown promise in early trials and a phase II/III trial is near completion. Referral to Dermatology should be considered for management of warts, which can be very difficult to treat. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is currently the only curative treatment.

Sensitivity to Ionizing Radiation, also known as Cernunnos-XLF deficiency, is a rare, autosomal recessive form of combined immunodeficiency characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, and T and B cell lymphopenia with normal levels of NK cells. This disease is caused by variants in the NHEJ1 (or Cernunnos) gene located on chromosome 2q35. The resulting defect of Cernunnos/XLF, a core protein of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, affects the major mechanism of DNA double-strand break repair. Patients present in infancy or childhood with growth retardation, microcephaly, urogenital and bone malformations, dysmorphic features (''bird-like'' facial dysmorphism) and features of combined immunodeficiency including recurrent opportunistic, viral and bacterial infections. Some patients may also present with autoimmune cytopenia (anemia and thrombocytopenia). Fibroblasts have increased radiosensitivity.  This condition is clinically similar to other DNA repair defect syndromes (Nijmegen breakage syndrome and LIG 4 deficiency). Interestingly, one clinically immunocompetent patient has been described in the literature who presented with failure to thrive, proportionate microcephaly and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and was subsequently found to have a homozygous pathogenic variant in NHEJ1.  Treatment is based on antibiotic treatment of infections, immunoglobulin replacement, antiviral prophylaxis and allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Radiotherapy as part of conditioning regimens should be avoided. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens are favored.  Without treatment, the immunodeficiency may result in severe infection, sepsis and early death.  Prevalence is unknown. To date, fewer than 30 cases have been reported in the literature.

The CYBA gene provides instructions for making the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain, also known as p22-phox. This protein is one subunit of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Within this complex, the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain has a beta chain partner (produced from the CYBB gene). Both alpha and beta chains are required for either to function, and the NADPH oxidase complex requires both chains in order to be functional. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in phagocytes, cells that catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of neutrophils, cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.  NADPH oxidase participates in a chemical reaction that generates superoxides from oxygen. Superoxide is then used to generate reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid) that are bactericidal and fungicidal, preventing bacteria and fungi from reproducing in the body and causing illness.   Chronic granulomatous disease is a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, most commonly pneumonia, osteomyelitis and cellulitis. Hepatic abscesses are also a common feature of this condition and may require surgical drainage.  People with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues, including symptoms similar to inflammatory bowel disease. Management of inflammatory bowel disease can be complicated but generally follows standard protocols.  The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life.  Acute treatment of infections requires a definitive microbiologic diagnosis for proper antimicrobial treatment. Fungal infections may be more amenable to treatment with newer azole drugs, such as voriconazole, posaconazole or isovuconazole. Long courses of treatment with antimicrobials are often necessary. Abscesses may require surgical drainage. Co-administration of antimicrobials and corticosteroids have been effective in treating the heightened inflammatory response, including colitis. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered curative; however, indications and timing of HSCT have not yet been defined. Immunomodulatory therapy with interferon gamma is used as prophylaxis by many centers, along with antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis.  Chronic granulomatous disease is estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 to 250,000 people worldwide. Mutations in the CYBA gene cause less than 5 percent of all cases of this condition.   ", "Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life.People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal infections in their lungs. Other common areas of infection in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes.Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with chronic granulomatous disease. Most commonly, granulomas occur in the gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract. In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Additionally, granulomas within the gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses). Inflammation in the stomach can prevent food from passing through to the intestines (gastric outlet obstruction), leading to an inability to digest food. These digestive problems cause vomiting after eating and weight loss. In the genitourinary tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Inflammation of the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) and bone marrow (osteomyelitis), which both produce immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system.Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs.Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of individuals with chronic granulomatous disease; however, with treatment, most affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood."], "alternate_names": ["GRANULOMATOUS

They are characterized by mycobacterial infections, occurring in males.  The CYBB gene (Xp21.1) encodes the p91-phox subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. This protein is an integral subunit of the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase. NAPDH oxidase plays an essential role in the immune system.

These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body. Unlike the more severe X-linked chronic granulomatous disease caused by mutations in CYBB, mutations that cause Immunodeficiency 34 (Thr178Pro, Glu231Pro) do not impair the respiratory burst in granulocytes and monocytes, but they impair macrophages and B-cell lines selectively .

The CYBB gene provides instructions for making cytochrome b-245, beta chain, also known as p91-phox. This protein is an integral subunit of the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase. NAPDH oxidase plays an essential role in the immune system. Cytochrome b-245, beta chain interacts with the product of CYBA (cytochrome b-245, alpha chain; p22-phox), the alpha chain of NADPH oxidase. Both alpha and beta chains are required for either to function and the NADPH oxidase complex requires both chains to be functional. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in phagocytes, cells that catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body. The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase. NADPH oxidase then participates in a chemical reaction that converts oxygen to a toxic molecule, superoxide. Superoxide is used to generate reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.  More than 650 mutations in the CYBB gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. Mutations in the CYBB gene cause approximately 70 percent of all cases of this condition. If either CYBB or CYBA do not function, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders, and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation.  Chronic granulomatous disease is a form of immunodeficiency. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People with this condition may also develop granulomas in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear during infancy and childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life.  People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. Pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Patients are particularly susceptible to a fungal pneumonia after exposure to decaying organic materials (mulch pneumonitis).  Other common areas of infection in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes. Granulomas most commonly occur in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts.  In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Additionally, granulomas within the gastrointestinal tract can lead to abscess formation. Inflammation in the stomach can result in gastric outlet obstruction, leading to an inability to digest food, causing postprandial emesis and weight loss.  In the genitourinary tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Inflammation of the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) and bone marrow (osteomyelitis),  organs important for production of immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system. Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders. Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of individuals with chronic granulomatous disease; however, with treatment, most affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood.  Treatment of infections requires a definitive diagnosis and often requires treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. Newer azole drugs (voriconazole, posaconazole, isovuconazole) are more effective against fungal infections. Long courses of antimicrobial treatment are often required. Abscesses may require drainage or surgical excision. Administration of antimicrobials and corticosteroids may help minimize the associated heightened inflammatory response, particularly colitis. Pioglitazone has been tried as a treatment but there is currently no evidence for efficacy.  Prevention of infections with antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis is a mainstay of treatment. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is often used for prophylaxis as well. Very early onset IBD is a hallmark of this condition. A pediatric gastroenterologist should be consulted and colitis should be managed accordingly. Special care must be taken to use Kell negative red blood cell transfusions, if transfusions are needed, in individuals with CGD caused by contiguous deletions of the X chromosome that include the Kx (Kell) antigen (McLeod syndrome).  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only known cure for CGD although parameters regarding indication and timing have yet to be established.   Chronic granulomatous disease average worldwide birth prevalence is estimated to be between 1/100,000 and 1/217,000, of which 70% of cases are caused by mutations in CYBB.  ", "Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life.People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal infections in their lungs. Other common areas of infection in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes.Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with chronic granulomatous disease. Most commonly, granulomas occur in the gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract. In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Additionally, granulomas within the gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses). Inflammation in the stomach can prevent food from passing through to the intestines (gastric outlet obstruction), leading to an inability to digest food. These digestive problems cause vomiting after eating and weight loss. In the genitourinary tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Inflammation of the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) and bone marrow (osteomyelitis), which both produce immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system.Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs.Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce

The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. In people with CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens, which are male sex hormones.There are two types of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, the classic form and the non-classic form. The classic form is the more severe of the two types.Females with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female (atypical genitalia). However, the internal reproductive organs develop normally. Males and females with the classic form of this condition have early development of their secondary sexual characteristics such as growth of facial and pubic hair, deepening of the voice, appearance of acne, and onset of a growth spurt. The early growth spurt can prevent growth later in adolescence and lead to short stature in adulthood. In addition, approximately two-thirds of individuals with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have high blood pressure (hypertension). Hypertension typically develops within the first year of life.Females with the non-classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have normal female genitalia. As affected females get older, they may develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism) and irregular menstruation.

Two types are classic forms, known as the salt-wasting and simple virilizing types. The third type is called the non-classic type. The salt-wasting type is the most severe, the simple virilizing type is less severe, and the non-classic type is the least severe form.Males and females with either classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency tend to have an early growth spurt, but their final adult height is usually shorter than others in their family. Additionally, affected individuals may have a reduced ability to have biological children (decreased fertility). Females may also develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism), male pattern baldness, and irregular menstruation.Approximately 75 percent of individuals with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency have the salt-wasting type. Hormone production is extremely low in this form of the disorder. Affected individuals lose large amounts of sodium in their urine, which can be life-threatening in early infancy. Babies with the salt-wasting type can experience poor feeding, weight loss, dehydration, and vomiting. Individuals with the simple virilizing form do not experience salt loss.In both the salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms of this disorder, females typically have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia).

The DKC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called dyskerin. This protein is involved in maintaining telomeres, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or degrading. In most cells, telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides. After a certain number of cell divisions, the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to undergo apoptosis. Telomeres are maintained by two important protein complexes, telomerase and shelterin. Telomerase counteracts the shortening of telomeres by adding small repeated segments of DNA to the ends of chromosomes each time the cell divides. One component of telomerase, called hTR, provides a template for creating the repeated sequence of DNA that telomerase adds to the ends of chromosomes. The dyskerin protein binds to hTR and helps stabilize the telomerase complex. In most types of cells, telomerase is either undetectable or active at very low levels. However, it is highly active in cells that divide rapidly, such as cells that line the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, cells in bone marrow, and cells of the developing fetus. Telomerase allows these cells to divide many times without becoming damaged or undergoing apoptosis. Telomerase is also abnormally active in most cancer cells, which grow and divide without control or order. Dyskerin is also involved in the production of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and is active in particles that modify rRNA by converting uridine to pseudouridine. Symptoms develop due to the inability of cells to maintain telomeres.   The classic features of Dyskeratosis Congenita are the triad of abnormal skin pigment, leukoplakia and nail dystrophy with progression to bone marrow failure in 80% of cases. The phenotype can be quite variable and may include features of premature graying, osteoporosis, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, testicular atrophy and lacrimal duct atresia. Affected individuals also have a predisposition to malignancy. Age of onset is typically in young adulthood but can present in childhood. Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome is a severe form of X-Linked Dyskeratosis Congenita that presents early in childhood and has additional features of cerebellar hypoplasia developmental delay, immunodeficiency, and intrauterine growth retardation. The mainstay of treatment for this condition is supportive, malignancy surveillance and HSCT once bone marrow failure develops. This is a rare condition, and the prevalence is unknown. However, it is estimated that up to 5% of bone marrow failure is due to some type of Dyskeratosis Congenita and DKC1 is responsible for about \u00bc of Dyskeratosis Congenita cases.

Several different genes have been found to be responsible for the Brugada syndrome phenotype. One of these is GPD1L (chromosome 3p22.2) which encodes a cytosolic plasma-associated protein that binds to the SCN5A-encoded sodium channel protein and catalyzes the conversion of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to glycerone phosphate. It functions in regulating the cardiac sodium current: increased levels of glycerol-3-phosphate activate the DPD1L-dependent SCN5A phosphorylation pathway which results in a decreased sodium current which is arrhythmogenic. Variants in this gene cause autosomal dominantly inherited BRUGADA SYNDROME 2.  The main symptom of Brugada syndrome is irregular heartbeats that, without treatment, may potentially result in sudden death.  Recent reports suggest that Brugada syndrome could be responsible up to 20% of sudden death in patients with structurally normal hearts. Brugada syndrome may affect individuals of any age, but symptoms most often occur in middle-aged men around the age of 40. Frequently, sudden death can be the first manifestation of the disease. Recommendations for treatment of asymptomatic individuals are controversial.  Treatment may be pharmacologic with either isoprenaline or quinidine for unstable ventricular arrhythmias.  Individuals at a high risk of ventricular fibrillation are treated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators or epicardial substrate ablation. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease and follows autosomal dominant inheritance. It is most commonly caused by variants in SCN5A. Currently, the prevalence of Brugada syndrome is estimated at 5 in 10,000 people. The prevalence of Brugada syndrome caused by GPD1L variants is unknown.

The DLD gene provides instructions for making dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. This enzyme forms one subunit (E3) of several enzyme complexes, including branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (\u03b1KGDH).  These complexes are essential for the catabolism of branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), as well as the conversion of  pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and the conversion of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. These are all important in the generation of ATP and energy.  Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency is a severe condition that can affect several body systems. Signs and symptoms of this condition usually appear shortly after birth, and they can vary widely among affected individuals. A common feature of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency is a potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis, which can cause nausea, vomiting, severe breathing problems, and an abnormal heartbeat. Neurological problems are also common in this condition; the first symptoms in affected infants are often hypotonia and lethargy. As the problems worsen, affected infants can have difficulty feeding, decreased alertness, and seizures. Liver problems, ranging from hepatomegaly to life threatening liver failure can also occur. In some, liver disease, which can begin anytime from infancy to adulthood, is the primary symptom and is associated with recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain. Rarely, people with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency experience weakness of the skeletal muscles, particularly during exercise; droopy eyelids; or cardiomyopathy. Other features of this condition include hyperammonemia, ketoacidosis, or hypoglycemia. Typically, the signs and symptoms of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency occur in episodes that may be triggered by fever, injury, or other stresses on the body. Affected individuals are usually symptom-free between episodes. Many infants with this condition do not survive the first few years of life because of the severity of these episodes. Affected individuals who survive past early childhood often have delayed growth and neurological problems, including intellectual disability, spasticity, ataxia, and seizures.   There are currently no consensus recommendations for the management of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase  deficiency. Management can be difficult as various metabolic pathways are affected and 3 enzyme complexes are involved. Deficiencies in enzyme pathways vary depending on the specific mutation(s) each affected person has.  Treatments that have been attempted in children with the early-onset neurologic form do not appear to significantly alter the course of the disease. Even with treatment, children often do not survive infancy or have varying degrees of chronic neurologic impairment if they survive the initial episode. Depending on individual enzyme complex deficiencies, treatment may involve dietary management- some have responded to dietary modification. Dichloroacetic acid has been used in cases of refractory lactic acidosis, although outcomes may not change.  There is limited data for the chronic management of people with the primarily hepatic form of the disease. Acetylcysteine has been used to protect against liver damage. Treatment is generally supportive therapy during episodes of acute liver injury or failure or metabolic acidosis, including correction of coagulopathy.  Continuous Veno-Venous Hemofiltration can be considered as a temporary treatment of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia. IV glucose is used to treat hypoglycemia.   Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency occurs in an estimated 1 in 35,000 to 48,000 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with liver disease as the primary presentation. In other populations, the prevalence of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency is unknown, but the condition is likely rare.

DMD, is the largest known human gene. It encodes a protein, dystrophin, that is found primarily in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Smaller amounts are found in nerve cells in the brain. In skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, dystrophin is part of a protein complex that imparts strength to and protects muscle fibers from injury as muscles contract and relax. It may also play a role in cell signaling by interacting with signaling molecules. Little is known about its function in nerve cells, although it is thought that dystrophin is important for the normal structure and function of synapses.    Dystrophinopathies present with a spectrum of severity. Becker Muscular Dystrophy is at the mildest end of the spectrum and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is the most severe. An intermediate phenotype is also possible. At the mildest end of the spectrum exercise-induced muscle cramps and myoglobinuria may be the only feature while at the severe end, there may be complete loss of muscle function, cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure.     Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) genetic variants tend to result in frameshifts, while Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) variants are in-frame. Mutations that cause Becker muscular dystrophy usually lead to production of an abnormal version of dystrophin that retains some function. Mutations that cause the more severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically prevent any functional dystrophin from being produced. DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by pathogenic variants in DMD that affect the muscle promoter (PM) and the first exon. This results in absence of  dystrophin expression in cardiac muscle. Two alternative promoters are active in the brain/Purkinje cells and skeletal muscle resulting in dystrophin expression sufficient to prevent manifestation of skeletal muscle symptoms.    DMD presents in early childhood, gross motor milestones may be  delayed. Brain involvement leads to cognitive impairment, present in about one-third of patients and/or pervasive behavioral disorders such as ADHD, autism, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder at later ages. Muscle hypertrophy is evident, especially in the calf muscles. Progression is rapid, such that by the age of 5 there is likely to be a waddling gait and positive Gowers' sign. In untreated boys, walking is usually lost by 13 years of age (mean 9.5 years). Following loss of ambulation, scoliosis, respiratory failure and cardiomyopathy develop. Cardiomyopathy occurs in almost all individuals with DMD after age 18. Few survive beyond the third decade, with respiratory complications and progressive cardiomyopathy being common causes of death.     BMD presents with a broad spectrum of clinical severity, with onset of skeletal muscle weakness occurring from early childhood to as late as the sixth decade. Despite the milder skeletal muscle involvement, heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death in BMD. Mean age of death is in the mid-40s.     Female manifesting carriers of DMD and BMD may present with varying degrees of cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness.     X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM), which may also be caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, presents with very severe, rapidly progressive, dilated cardiomyopathy.     Neither DMD or BMD is likely to initially present in the NICU or PICU, while X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy, which usually has onset between 10-20 years of age, may be identified in the PICU.    There is no known cure for this group of dystrophinopathies. Corticosteroids are the foundation of treatment in DMD as inflammatory cell activation is a factor in DMD. Treatment with corticosteroids stabilizes motor function and delays loss of ambulation and respiratory failure by several years. Deflazacort, a derivative of prednisone with fewer systemic side effects has been approved in the USA for patients 2 years and older for the treatment of DMD. Physiotherapy and orthotics delay the onset of joint contractures. Non-invasive ventilation  to treat respiratory failure prolongs life expectancy. Regular cardiac monitoring from diagnosis with early treatment using ACE  inhibitors and beta blockers stabilizes cardiomyopathy.    Recently, antisense oligonucleotides have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of some cases of DMD. It is estimated that about 8% of patients with DMD have a genetic mutation amenable to exon 53 skipping of the dystrophin gene, and about 13% of patients have a mutation amenable to exon 51 skipping. Not all patients respond to or are candidates for antisense oligonucleotides. These treatments are not a cure for DMD but may help improve muscle symptoms.  As of 2021, Amondys 45 (casimersen), for the treatment of patients with DMD who have genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping, Viltepso (viltolarsen), and Vyondys 53 (golodirsen)  for DMD  genetic mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping, and Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) for  genetic mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping are approved in the USA. These are provided by injection or infusion on a weekly basis.     The treatment of BMD focuses on lessening the severity of associated symptoms. There is no cure, but treatments are available to help with symptoms and maximize muscle function. It is vital that a person with BMD stay in shape and continue to exercise and use their muscles. This can include low intensity aerobic training. Treatment can also include the use of splints, massages, and catabolic steroids. It is probable that affected individuals will eventually require a wheelchair.    For XLDCM, standard therapy for cardiac failure leading to cardiac transplantation. which is the treatment of choice.    The prevalence of DMD ranges between 1/3,500-1/ 9,300 male births. The prevalence of BMD varies from 1/16,700 to 1/18,500 male births. The prevalence of symptomatic female carriers is unknown. X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy appears to be an uncommon condition, although its prevalence is unknown.

The SLC52A2 gene provides instructions for making a riboflavin transporter protein,  RFVT2 (formerly known as RFT3). This protein transports riboflavin (vitamin B2) across the cell membrane. Riboflavin is the core component of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN). These molecules function as coenzymes and are required for a variety of cellular processes, including energy production and carbohydrate, fate and protein metabolism.  The RFVT2 protein is found at especially high levels in cells of the brain and spinal cord and is important for absorbing riboflavin from the bloodstream into these tissues.  Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome-2 was previously considered to cause two distinct neurologic syndromes: Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and Fazio-Londe disease. These are no longer considered to be separate disorders but can be caused by pathogenic variants in either the SLC52A2 or the SLC52A3 gene and are now known as riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy. The age at which riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy begins varies from infancy to young adulthood. When the condition begins in infancy, the first symptom is often breathing problems caused by nerve damage, which can be life-threatening. When the condition begins in children or young adults, sensorineural hearing loss usually occurs first, followed by signs of pontobulbar palsy.  Nerves in the pontobulbar region help control several voluntary muscle activities, including breathing, speaking, and moving the limbs. As a result of pontobulbar palsy, affected individuals may develop breathing problems, slurred speech, and muscle weakness in the face, neck, shoulders, and limbs. Spasticity and exaggerated reflexes may also be present.  Treatment with high dose riboflavin is lifesaving.  Daily administration of high dose oral riboflavin supplementation should be started immediately upon suspicion of riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy. Treatment is lifelong. In cases with early onset, assisted ventilation, tracheostomy, and maintenance of nutrition via gastrostomy may be necessary. Regular clinical evaluation, including neurological examination, hearing and vision exams, evaluation of respiratory function and screening for skeletal deformities such as scoliosis,  is required. Depending on the symptoms, physical and speech therapy should be initiated. Cochlear implants have proven highly successful for hearing loss in this disorder.  If untreated, the signs and symptoms of riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy worsen over time. Severe breathing problems and respiratory infections are the usual cause of death in people with this condition. Without treatment, affected infants typically survive less than one year. However, those who develop the condition after age 4 often survive more than 10 years. Treatment with riboflavin is lifesaving.  Riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy is a rare condition. Approximately 100 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.

Variants in this gene have also been shown to cause Familial Hemiplegic Migraine, Familial Infantile Convulsions with Paroxysmal Choreoathetosis (infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis - ICCA), and Benign Familial Infantile Seizures 2 (BFIS). Phenotypes associated with the same variant can be variable within the same family. The PRRT2 gene provides instructions for making the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2). The function of this protein is unknown, although it is thought to be involved in signaling in the brain. It is known to  interact with another protein, SNAP25, which is involved in the release of neurotransmitters and interneuron signaling in the brain. The 649dupC mutation, which is also found in patients with hemiplegic migraine,  is the most common genetic change in familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia. At least 10 mutations have been found to cause familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia.  Most PRRT2 gene mutations involved in this condition, including 649dupC, lead to generation of an unstable protein that is rapidly degraded and results in haploinsufficiency. Decreased levels of PRRT2 are thought to affect SNAP25 function resulting in dysregulation of neurotransmitter release and abnormal interneuron signaling. This altered neuronal activity could underlie the movement problems characteristic of familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, but the exact mechanism is unknown.  The condition is characterized by episodes of abnormal movements triggered by sudden motion, such as standing up quickly or being startled. Movements may include dystonia, chorea, athetosis, or ballismus and may be uni- or bilateral. The type of abnormal movement varies among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. In many people with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia,  an aura immediately precedes the episode. The aura is often described as a crawling or tingling sensation in the affected body part. Individuals with this condition do not lose consciousness during an episode and do not experience any symptoms between episodes. As suggested by the name, the abnormal movements come and go over time (paroxysmal), are triggered by movement (kinesigenic) and are involuntary (dyskinesia). Episodes typically last less than five minutes, and the frequency of episodes ranges from one per month to 100 per day. In most affected individuals, episodes occur less often with age. These abnormal movements can range from mild to severe, with usual onset during childhood or adolescence, although onset in infancy as benign infantile convulsions has been described. Benign infantile convulsions usually develop in the first year of life and stop by age 3. When benign infantile convulsions are associated with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, the condition is known as infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA). In families with ICCA, some individuals develop only benign infantile convulsions, some have only familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, and others develop both. Although described as separate disorders, it has been speculated that paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, BFIS, ICCA, and familial hemiplegic migraine may represent a spectrum of related disorders.  It is unclear how this mutation can cause one condition in some people and a different condition in others.  Attacks are suppressed or dramatically reduced by low-dose anticonvulsant medication such as oxcarbazepine or carbamazepine. If first-line antiepileptic drugs are ineffective, then lamotrigine, valproic acid or phenytoin have been used.  The prognosis of PKD is usually favorable, with improvement of the attacks and even remission in adulthood. A gender difference in prognosis is also observed, with woman having a better prognosis and a higher chance of complete remission. An improvement of attacks can also be observed during pregnancy.  Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is estimated to occur in 1 in 150,000 individuals. For unknown reasons, this condition affects more males than females.  ", "Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by episodes of abnormal movement that range from mild to severe. In the condition name, the word paroxysmal indicates that the abnormal movements come and go over time, kinesigenic means that episodes are triggered by movement, and dyskinesia refers to involuntary movement of the body.People with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia experience episodes of irregular jerking or shaking movements that are induced by sudden motion, such as standing up quickly or being startled. An episode may involve slow, prolonged muscle contractions (dystonia); small, fast, dance-like motions (chorea); writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis); or, rarely, flailing movements of the limbs (ballismus). Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia may affect one or both sides of the body. The type of abnormal movement varies among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. In many people with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, a pattern of symptoms called an aura immediately precedes the episode. The aura is often described as a crawling or tingling sensation in the affected body part.

Variants in this gene can also cause Episodic Dyskinesia 1, Familial Infantile Convulsions with Paroxysmal Choreoathetosis, and Benign Familial Infantile Seizures 2. Phenotypes associated with the same variant can be variable within the same family. The PRRT2 gene provides instructions for making the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2). The function of this protein is unknown, although it is thought to be involved in signaling in the brain. It is known to  interact with another protein, SNAP25, which is involved in the release of neurotransmitters and signaling between neurons in the brain. At least two mutations in the PRRT2 gene have been identified in people with familial hemiplegic migraine (c.649delC and c.649dupC) resulting in loss of function and haploinsufficiency of PRRT2.   Familial hemiplegic migraine (HM) is a form of migraine headache with aura in which attacks are associated with transient motor weakness or hemiparesis. Migraines usually cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in late childhood or adolescence, with the frequency of attacks ranging from a few per week to one per month.  Triggers can include certain foods, stress, anxiety, light or heat. In the case of PRRT2-related HM, motor aura duration can last anywhere from 30-60 seconds to as long as 72 hours before onset of the headache.   Each headache may last from a few hours to a few days . The disproportion between time of  onset of aura and duration of migraine is unique to HM caused by PRRT2. This condition is responsive to low-dose carbamazepine. Prognosis is usually good.  The prevalence of hemiplegic migraine (HM) is one in 10,000, with familial and sporadic forms being equally frequent. The exact prevalence and incidence of familial hemiplegic migraine caused by PRRT2 is not known.

This gene provides instructions for making the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT). PCFT is involved in active transport of folates across the intestinal brush border membrane and is also involved in folate transport across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Folates are important for many cell functions, including DNA and RNA synthesis.  A defect in this protein leads to a systemic folate and CNS folate deficiency. Infants cannot absorb adequate folate from breast milk/formula and become deficient once stores accumulated during gestation are exhausted. Disease onset usually occurs a few months after birth. Megaloblastic anemia is the primary manifestation of HFM and can be very severe if untreated. Other clinical manifestations include failure to thrive, diarrhea and/or oral mucositis, various neurological manifestations (motor impairment, seizures, developmental delay, cognitive and behavioral disorders) and hypoimmunoglobulinemia.  Hypoimmunoglobulinemia results in unusual infections with Pneumocystis jiroveccii, C. difficile and cytomegalovirus  which can be recurrent and life-threatening in undiagnosed infants. Neurological manifestations may be the presenting symptoms in some but are absent in others. Seizures, if present, begin in infancy or later in childhood. Intracranial calcifications have been observed in some.  High dose oral or parenteral 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF, folinic acid) and oral L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-methylTHF) are the two types of reduced folates used to treat HFM. Dosage is monitored and individualized for each patient so that the CSF folate levels remain within the normal range (around 100nM in infants and children to 2 years of age). Folic acid should not be used as it binds strongly to folate receptors and blocks folate transport. If anemia is severe, a transfusion may be necessary. If transfusion is necessary, blood products appropriate to the status of the affected individual should be used (e.g. washed packed red blood cells for those with IgA-deficiency). Early treatment with reduced folates before the appearance of symptoms can prevent the metabolic consequences of HFM. Patients should have regular blood tests to monitor complete blood count, serum and CSF folate and homocysteine concentrations and serum immunoglobulin concentrations.  Prognosis is good with appropriate treatment and reversal of most of the systemic consequences of the disease is usually achieved. Prognosis is poor only when untreated.  The prevalence is unknown.

Dysplasia with Early-Onset Diabetes Mellitus, also known as Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS), is a very rare autosomal recessive genetic disease, characterized by permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus or early infancy insulin-dependent diabetes. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, osteoporosis, and growth retardation develop at a later age. Other frequent multisystem manifestations include hepatic and renal dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and cardiovascular abnormalities. WRS is caused by variants in the EIF2AK3 gene located on chromosome 2p11.2. This gene encodes eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3 (PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; PERK), which plays a key role in translation control during unfolded protein response. The PERK protein phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2, leading to its inactivation, and to a rapid reduction of initiation of translation and repression of global protein synthesis. This protein is also thought to modulate mitochondrial function. It is a type I membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is induced by ER stress caused by misfolded proteins.  Onset of diabetes is usually before 6 months of age, is permanent and insulin-dependent from the onset. Skeletal dysplasia generally manifests within the 1st or 2nd year of life and is associated with short stature (short trunk dwarfism). Deficient mineralization or dysplastic changes, affecting the long bones, pelvis and vertebrae, but usually not the skull, may be seen radiographically as early as diabetes onset. Hepatic dysfunction is the most life-threatening complication, and manifests as elevated hepatic enzymes, liver enlargement and recurrent acute liver failure. Other manifestations vary between patients in type and severity and include renal dysfunction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, intellectual deficits, hypothyroidism, neutropenia and recurrent infections. Clinical course is variable, even within the same sibship.  Close therapeutic monitoring of diabetes should be considered and treatment with an insulin pump is recommended, especially in the first months of life, due to the risk of acute episodes of hypoglycemia. At any age, hypoglycemia should be prevented because the disease can decompensate, even if this requires maintaining the level of glucose above the objectives generally recommended in diabetic children. Patients are particularly sensitive to anesthetics and general anesthesia, which increases the risk of acute aggravation, should be avoided wherever possible. Any drug or vaccine not strictly necessary should be limited, due to the risk of triggering secondary liver and/or kidney failure.  Prognosis is poor and most patients die at a young age from multiple-organ failure with predominant liver and renal dysfunction  Fewer than 60 cases have been reported to date. Most patients are from consanguineous families. Prevalence may therefore vary significantly between countries. WRS may be underdiagnosed because of early death before diagnosis.

In addition, they may have hearing loss or softening and weakening of the bones (rickets).Some individuals with GACI also develop features similar to those of another disorder called pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). PXE is characterized by the accumulation of calcium and other minerals (mineralization) in elastic fibers, which are a component of connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. Features characteristic of PXE that also occur in GACI include yellowish bumps called papules on the underarms and other areas of skin that touch when a joint bends (flexor areas); and abnormalities called angioid streaks affecting tissue at the back of the eye, which can be detected during an eye examination.As a result of the cardiovascular problems associated with GACI, individuals with this condition often do not survive past infancy, with death typically caused by a heart attack or stroke.

This DNA repair function is key to repair of ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage. The main clinical characteristic of XPF is sun/UV light sensitivity leading to skin cancers. XPF is not as severe as some other types of XP. Some patients with XPF may develop neurologic impairment or growth defects and are then classified as having XP-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS-F). Presentation may include pre- or post-natal growth failure, progressive problems with hearing, vision, and neurologic function. Cancer incidence is lower in XP-CS compared to XP alone and higher than in CS without XP. ERCC4 variants also cause Fanconi anemia complementation group Q: there have been reports of individuals with ERCC4 variants who have features of XP, CS and Fanconi anemia. Age of symptom onset is typically before 2 years of age. The mainstay of treatment for these conditions is avoidance of exposure to sunlight and other sources of UV light. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended because of the need for avoidance of sunlight and UV light. This is a rare condition.  Prevalence of all types of XP is about 1 in 1 million. XPF is most prevalent in Japan and explains ~7% of XP cases.", "Xeroderma pigmentosum, which is commonly known as XP, is an inherited condition characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. This condition mostly affects the eyes and areas of skin exposed to the sun. Some affected individuals also have problems involving the nervous system.The signs of xeroderma pigmentosum usually appear in infancy or early childhood. Many affected children develop a severe sunburn after spending just a few minutes in the sun. The sunburn causes redness and blistering that can last for weeks. Other affected children do not get sunburned with minimal sun exposure, but instead tan normally. By age 2, almost all children with xeroderma pigmentosum develop freckling of the skin in sun-exposed areas (such as the face, arms, and lips); this type of freckling rarely occurs in young children without the disorder. In affected individuals, exposure to sunlight often causes dry skin (xeroderma) and changes in skin coloring (pigmentation). This combination of features gives the condition its name, xeroderma pigmentosum.People with xeroderma pigmentosum have a greatly increased risk of developing skin cancer. Without sun protection, about half of children with this condition develop their first skin cancer by age 10. Most people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop multiple skin cancers during their lifetime. These cancers occur most often on the face, lips, and eyelids. Cancer can also develop on the scalp, in the eyes, and on the tip of the tongue. Studies suggest that people with xeroderma pigmentosum may also have an increased risk of other types of cancer, including brain tumors. Additionally, affected individuals who smoke cigarettes have a significantly increased risk of lung cancer.The eyes of people with xeroderma pigmentosum may be painfully sensitive to UV rays from the sun. If the eyes are not protected from the sun, they may become bloodshot and irritated, and the clear front covering of the eyes (the cornea) may become cloudy. In some people, the eyelashes fall out and the eyelids may be thin and turn abnormally inward or outward. In addition to an increased risk of eye cancer, xeroderma pigmentosum is associated with noncancerous growths on the eye. Many of these eye abnormalities can impair vision.About 30 percent of people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop progressive neurological abnormalities in addition to problems involving the skin and eyes. These abnormalities can include hearing loss, poor coordination, difficulty walking, movement problems, loss of intellectual function, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures. When these neurological problems occur, they tend to worsen with time.Researchers have identified at least eight inherited forms of xeroderma pigmentosum: complementation group A (XP-A) through complementation group G (XP-G) plus a variant type (XP-V). The types are distinguished by their genetic cause.

Variants in this gene also cause Xeroderma pigmentosum, group F, Xeroderma pigmentosum,typeF/Cockayne syndrome and XFE progeroid syndrome. ERCC4 encodes a DNA repair endonuclease, XPF. ERCC4 forms the ERCC1-XPF complex with the protein product of the ERCC1 gene. This complex participates in DNA recombination and DNA repair. Nucleotide excision repair requires 2 separate incisions, one on each side of a lesion. These two incisions are catalyzed by separate DNA endonucleases. One is a 3-prime endonuclease and the other is a 5-prime endonuclease. The nuclease enzyme complex ERCC1-XPF participates in nucleotide excision repair by cutting specific DNA structures at the 5-prime end of a DNA lesion. It also plays a role in interstrand crosslink repair.  Detailed cellular studies  have demonstrated that Fanconi anemia cells with ERCC4 mutations are completely deficient in interstrand crosslink repair, but retain some level of nucleotide excision repair activity: functional studies have demonstrated that the mutations result either in impaired nuclease incision activity or in abnormal aggregation of the protein in the cytoplasm.    Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations (hypopigmentation or caf\u00e9 au lait macules; malformed thumbs or forearms; short stature; malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract defects; gastrointestinal abnormalities; heart defects; eye abnormalities; malformed ears and hearing loss; malformations of the genitalia or reproductive system; central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus, microcephaly),  hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. Fanconi anemia can be caused by mutations in any one of 16 genes, whose protein products function in a DNA repair pathway. The major complications are aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and specific solid tumors. While a severe subset (FANCD1/BRCA2) has a cumulative incidence of cancer of 97% by age 7 years, other genotypes (FANCA through FANCQ) have cumulative risks of more than 50% of marrow failure, 20% of AML, and 30% of solid tumors (usually head and neck or gynecologic squamous cell carcinoma), by age 40, and are at risk of multiple adverse events.   Androgens improve the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil counts in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans.

The ETFB gene provides instructions for making the beta subunit of an enzyme called electron transfer flavoprotein. This enzyme is normally active in the mitochondria. Glutaric acidemia type II is an inherited disorder that interferes with the body's ability to break down proteins and fats to produce energy. Incompletely processed proteins and fats can build up in the body and cause the blood and tissues to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis).Glutaric acidemia type II usually appears in infancy or early childhood as a sudden episode called a metabolic crisis, in which acidosis and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) cause weakness, behavior changes such as poor feeding and decreased activity, and vomiting. These metabolic crises, which can be life-threatening, may be triggered by common childhood illnesses or other stresses .In the most severe cases of glutaric acidemia type II, affected individuals may also be born with physical abnormalities. These may include brain malformations, an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), a weakened and enlarged heart (dilated cardiomyopathy), fluid-filled cysts and other malformations of the kidneys, unusual facial features, and genital abnormalities. Glutaric acidemia type II may also cause a characteristic odor resembling that of sweaty feet. Some affected individuals have less severe symptoms that begin later in childhood or in adulthood. In the mildest forms of glutaric acidemia type II, muscle weakness developing in adulthood may be the first sign of the disorder. Some individuals may respond to treatment with riboflavin: symptoms and outcomes may differ significantly between riboflavin-responsive and unresponsive MADD deficiency: physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for MADD deficiency in all age groups.  The mainstay of treatment is avoidance of fasting, a high carbohydrate/low fat diet and levocarnitine to prevent carnitine deficiency along with provision of oral or IV glucose during intercurrent illness to prevent catabolism.", "Glutaric acidemia type II is an inherited disorder that interferes with the body's ability to break down proteins and fats to produce energy.

This enzyme is normally active in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. Mutations in this gene cause glutaric acidemia type II. Glutaric acidemia type II is an inherited disorder that interferes with the body's ability to break down proteins and fats to produce energy. Incompletely processed proteins and fats can build up in the body and cause the blood and tissues to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis).Glutaric acidemia type II usually appears in infancy or early childhood as a sudden episode called a metabolic crisis, in which acidosis and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) cause weakness, behavior changes such as poor feeding and decreased activity, and vomiting. These metabolic crises, which can be life-threatening, may be triggered by common childhood illnesses or other stresses .In the most severe cases of glutaric acidemia type II, affected individuals may also be born with physical abnormalities. These may include brain malformations, an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), a weakened and enlarged heart (dilated cardiomyopathy), fluid-filled cysts and other malformations of the kidneys, unusual facial features, and genital abnormalities. Glutaric acidemia type II may also cause a characteristic odor resembling that of sweaty feet. Some affected individuals have less severe symptoms that begin later in childhood or in adulthood. In the mildest forms of glutaric acidemia type II, muscle weakness developing in adulthood may be the first sign of the disorder. Some individuals may respond to treatment with riboflavin: symptoms and outcomes may differ significantly between riboflavin-responsive and unresponsive MADD deficiency: physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for MADD deficiency in all age groups. The mainstay of treatment is avoidance of fasting, a high carbohydrate/low fat diet and levocarnitine to prevent carnitine deficiency along with provision of oral or IV glucose during intercurrent illness to prevent catabolism.", "Glutaric acidemia type II is an inherited disorder that interferes with the body's ability to break down proteins and fats to produce energy.

Factor XIII deficiency can also be caused by variants in the F13B gene on chromosome 1q31.1. The F13A1 gene provides instructions for making the A subunit of Factor XIII. This is one of several coagulation factors that are essential for normal blood clotting as part of the coagulation cascade. This cascade is a series of chemical reactions that forms blood clots in response to injury. Factor XIII, also known as fibrin stabilizing factor, acts at the end of the cascade to strengthen and stabilize newly formed clots, preventing further blood loss. Factor XIII consists of two A subunits, produced from the F13A1 gene, and two B subunits, produced from the F13B gene. The A subunits have catalytic function, and the B subunits do not have enzymatic activity but are thought to serve as plasma carrier molecules. Factor XIII is activated by thrombin: the A and B subunits dissociate, yielding the active enzyme, factor XIIIa (platelet factor XIII). This active protein is a transglutaminase that forms gamma-glutamyl-lysyl amide crosslinks between fibrin macromolecules which stabilizes the clot against shear stress. Factor XIII may have additional functions beyond blood clotting, although these are less well understood. Specifically, it may be involved in other aspects of wound healing, immune system function, pregnancy maintenance, bone formation and angiogenesis.  Factor XIII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder. There are inherited and acquired forms of this condition: the inherited forms tend to be more severe. Signs and symptoms of inherited factor XIII deficiency begin soon after birth, usually with abnormal umbilical cord stump bleeding. If  untreated, affected individuals may have episodes of excessive and prolonged bleeding that can be life-threatening. Abnormal bleeding can occur after surgery or minor trauma. The condition can also cause spontaneous bleeding into the joints or muscles, leading to pain and disability. Women with inherited factor XIII deficiency tend to have menorrhagia and may experience recurrent miscarriages. Other signs and symptoms of inherited factor XIII deficiency include nosebleeds, bleeding of the gums, easy bruising, problems with wound healing and abnormal scar formation. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages are the most common cause of death in this disorder. Acquired factor XIII deficiency becomes apparent later in life. People with the acquired form are less likely to have severe or life-threatening episodes of abnormal bleeding than those with the inherited form.  The usual treatment for bleeding related to this deficiency is provision of Factor XIII concentrates or fresh frozen plasma (when FXIII concentrate or recombinant Factor XIII are not available). The decision to receive prophylactic therapy with FXIII concentrate to prevent recurrent bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage should be made after consultation with the patient's medical team.   Inherited factor XIII deficiency affects 1 to 3 per million people worldwide. It is thought that mild factor XIII deficiency, including the acquired form of the disorder, is underdiagnosed because many affected people never have a major episode of abnormal bleeding that would lead to a diagnosis.

After an injury, clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. Coagulation factor VIII is made chiefly by cells in the liver. This protein circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form, bound to another molecule called von Willebrand factor, until an injury that damages blood vessels occurs. In response to injury, coagulation factor VIII is activated and separates from von Willebrand factor. The active protein (factor VIIIa) interacts with another coagulation factor called factor IX. This interaction sets off a chain of additional chemical reactions that form a blood clot.

Treatment is with plasma-derived or recombinant factor VIII which is most effective when infused within one hour of the onset of bleeding. Immune tolerance therapy may become necessary. For those with mild disease, including most symptomatic females, the immediate treatment of bleeding with intravenous or nasal desmopressin acetate or factor VIII concentrate is effective.  For those with severe disease, treatment with prophylactic infusions of factor VIII concentrate three times a week or every other day to maintain factor VIII clotting activity higher than 1% nearly eliminates spontaneous bleeding and prevents chronic joint disease is standard of care.

People with hemophilia B Leyden experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few bleeding problems after puberty.  Acute treatment of bleeding episodes is by intravenous infusion of plasma-derived or recombinant factor IX to be given within an hour of noticing symptoms. Prophylactic factor IX infusions are often used for those with severe disease.  Hemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 newborn males worldwide.  ", "Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting process. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or oozing following an injury, surgery, or having a tooth pulled. In severe cases of hemophilia, continuous bleeding occurs after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Serious complications can result from bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or other internal organs. Milder forms of hemophilia do not necessarily involve spontaneous bleeding, and the condition may not become apparent until abnormal bleeding occurs following surgery or a serious injury.The major types of this condition are hemophilia A (also known as classic hemophilia or factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (also known as Christmas disease or factor IX deficiency). Although the two types have very similar signs and symptoms, they are caused by mutations in different genes.

Tyrosinemia type I, the most severe form of this disorder, is characterized by signs and symptoms that begin in the first few months of life. Affected infants fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) due to poor food tolerance because high-protein foods lead to diarrhea and vomiting. Affected infants may also have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), a cabbage-like odor, and an increased tendency to bleed (particularly nosebleeds). Tyrosinemia type I can lead to liver and kidney failure, softening and weakening of the bones (rickets), and an increased risk of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Some affected children have repeated neurologic crises that consist of changes in mental state, reduced sensation in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), abdominal pain, and respiratory failure. These crises can last from 1 to 7 days. Untreated, children with tyrosinemia type I often do not survive past the age of 10.Tyrosinemia type II can affect the eyes, skin, and mental development. Signs and symptoms often begin in early childhood and include eye pain and redness, excessive tearing, abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), and thick, painful skin on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis). About 50 percent of individuals with tyrosinemia type II have some degree of intellectual disability.Tyrosinemia type III is the rarest of the three types. The characteristic features of this type include intellectual disability, seizures, and periodic loss of balance and coordination (intermittent ataxia).About 10 percent of newborns have temporarily elevated levels of tyrosine (transient tyrosinemia).

"clinical_summary": ["Fanconi Anemia (FA) caused by pathogenic variants in Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A (FANCA) is a rare autosomal recessive condition.  FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. FANCA is located on chromosome 16q24.3. Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in this gene are one cause of Fanconi Anemia. The FANCA gene encodes one of a group of proteins that is involved in forming the FA core complex. The FA core complex is composed of eight FA proteins (including FANCA) plus two Fanconi anemia-associated proteins (FAAPs). These proteins are involved in a cellular process known as the FA pathway: this pathway is activated when DNA replication is blocked due to DNA damage, particularly interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). ICLs form when nucleotides on opposite strands of DNA are abnormally attached or linked together interrupting DNA replication. ICLs are caused by exposure to endogenous or exogenous mutagens (e.g., cancer therapy drugs). The FA core complex activates two other proteins, FANCD2 and FANCI, by monoubiquitination. This activation results in the formation of the ID complex which acts to attract DNA repair proteins to the area of DNA damage so the error can be corrected, and DNA replication can continue. Mutations in the FANCA gene lead to a nonfunctional FA core complex, which disrupts the entire FA pathway. As a result, DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and ICLs build up over time. The ICLs stall DNA replication, ultimately resulting in either abnormal cell death due to an inability to make new DNA molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of DNA repair processes. Cells that divide quickly, such as bone marrow cells and cells of the developing fetus, are particularly affected. The death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical abnormalities characteristic of Fanconi anemia. When the buildup of errors in DNA leads to uncontrolled cell growth, affected individuals can develop leukemia or other cancers.  FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.    Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.    Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. Approximately 60-70% of cases are caused by pathogenic variants in FANCA.

FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. FANCB is located on chromosome Xp22.2. Hemizygous pathogenic variants in this gene are one cause of Fanconi Anemia. In addition to chromosome instability, mutations in this gene can cause VACTERL syndrome with hydrocephalus.  The FANCB gene encodes one of a group of proteins that is involved in forming the FA core complex. The FA core complex is composed of eight FA proteins plus two Fanconi anemia-associated proteins (FAAPs). These proteins are involved in a cellular process known as the FA pathway: this pathway is activated when DNA replication is blocked due to DNA damage, particularly interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). ICLs form when nucleotides on opposite strands of DNA are abnormally attached or linked together interrupting DNA replication. ICLs are caused by exposure to endogenous and exogenous mutagens (e.g., cancer therapy drugs). The FA core complex activates two other proteins, FANCD2 and FANCI, by monoubiquitination. This activation results in the formation of the ID complex which acts to attract DNA repair proteins to the area of DNA damage so the error can be corrected, and DNA replication can continue. Mutations in the FANCB gene lead to a nonfunctional FA core complex, which disrupts the entire FA pathway. As a result, DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and ICLs build up over time. The ICLs stall DNA replication, ultimately resulting in either abnormal cell death due to an inability to make new DNA molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of DNA repair processes. Cells that divide quickly, such as bone marrow cells and cells of the developing fetus, are particularly affected. The death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical abnormalities characteristic of Fanconi anemia. When the buildup of errors in DNA leads to uncontrolled cell growth, affected individuals can develop leukemia or other cancers.  FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.      Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. Approximately 2% of cases are caused by pathogenic variants in FANCB.

VACTERL-H is generally considered to be a sporadic disorder and a consequence of defective differentiation of specific tissue types during early fetal development. However, in a subset of patients there is evidence for a familial component. Variants in FANCB have been associated with this condition. The FANCB gene is located on chromosome Xp22.31, thus inheritance of VACTERL-H associated with this gene would be in an X-linked recessive fashion. This gene encodes a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group B and, along with several other proteins, is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that is involved in the repair of DNA lesions. In addition to VACTERL-H, variants in this gene can cause chromosome instability and Fanconi anemia. It is important to rule out Fanconi anemia as this condition is associated with an increased risk for developing certain cancers (primarily acute myeloid leukemia, and certain solid tumors).   The term VACTERL is an acronym with each letter representing associated malformations:  \u2022\tVertebral anomalies (rib anomalies, hemivertebrae, butterfly vertebrae, wedge vertebrae, vertebral fusion, supernumerary vertebrae)  \u2022\tAnal atresia (imperforate anus/anal atresia)  \u2022\tCardiac defects (VSD, ASD, hypoplastic left heart, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, patent ductus arteriosus)  \u2022\tTracheoesophageal fistula  \u2022\tEsophageal atresia   \u2022\tRenal and radial anomalies (renal aplasia, renal ectopia, vesicoureteral reflux, hypospadias)  \u2022\tLimb anomalies (radial aplasia, radial hypoplasia, absent thumb, triphalangeal thumb, polydactyly, oligodactyly, syndactyly, radioulnar synostosis)  \u2022\tHydrocephalus  A single umbilical artery is also commonly reported.   Initial treatment is supportive with surgical interventions for those anomalies amenable to surgical repair. Even with the improvement of medical and surgical care, the long-term prognosis of patients with FANCB-associated VACTERL-H remains poor with early onset of hematologic disease and early death. In a 2020 report on 19 patients from 16 families with FANCB-associated VACTERL-H, those with truncating FANCB mutations were more severely affected with earlier age of onset of hematologic disease and death. Of 7 patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, irrespective of mutation type, 2 died from complications. Long-term survival data are not available, although at the time of the report, 5 of these patients were alive (age range 9-14 years). Quality of life was not assessed in this report. Of 8 patients who did not undergo HSCT, no one survived beyond 11.3 years of age, and the median survival was 15.05 months.   VACTERL with hydrocephalus related to FANCB is an extremely rare disorder that affects hemizygous males.  The exact prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. Variants in FANCB are felt to be responsible for about 2.2% of cases and 4% of male cases of Fanconi anemia.

FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. The FANCC gene encodes a protein that is involved in a cell process known as the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. The FANCC protein is one of a group of proteins known as the FA core complex, which is composed of eight FA proteins and two Fanconi anemia-associated proteins. The main function of this core complex with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity appears to be the posttranslational activations of FANCD2 and FANCI by monoubiquitination of specific lysine residues. The activation of these two proteins, which form the ID protein complex, attracts DNA repair proteins to the area of DNA damage so the error can be corrected and DNA replication can continue.  FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans.

FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. The FA pathway is complex and includes eight proteins and two Fanconi anemia-related proteins that form the FA core complex: the FA core complex activates FANCD2 and FANCI by monoubiquitination. The FANCD2 is monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage, resulting in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 and BRCA2) involved in homology-directed DNA repair and correction of errors so that DNA replication can continue.    FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. Mutations in FANCD2 cause approximately 3% of all FA cases.

FA is a rare genomic instability disorder that presents with bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslink-inducing agents, chromosome fragility and a high susceptibility to developing cancer. The FANCE protein is one of a group of eight proteins that forms the FA core complex. This complex activates two proteins, called FANCD2 and FANCI, by attaching a single molecule called ubiquitin to each of them (monoubiquitination). The activation of these two proteins which together form the ID protein complex, attracts DNA repair proteins to the area of DNA damage so the error can be corrected and DNA replication can continue. Without this function, errors cannot be corrected and DNA replication cannot occur, resulting in chromosome instability.   FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy for hematologic manifestations and may cure aplastic anemia, AML and MDS.  Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. Mutations in FANCE cause approximately 3% of all FA cases.

The FANCF protein is one of a group of eight proteins that forms the FA core complex.

Without this function, errors cannot be corrected and DNA replication cannot occur, resulting in chromosome instability.   FA is a condition that affects many parts of the body. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have impaired bone marrow function that results in the development of aplastic anemia. More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities which may include hypopigmentation, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, malformed thumbs or forearms, other skeletal anomalies including short stature, malformed or absent kidneys and other urinary tract abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, heart defects, eye abnormalities, ear abnormalities including hearing loss, abnormalities of the genitalia or reproductive tract, central nervous system abnormalities, hydrocephalus and/or microcephaly. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are at  an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in affected individuals is between 10 and 30 percent.  Treatment with androgens improves the blood counts in approximately 50% of individuals with FA. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used to improve the neutrophil count in some patients.

It accounts for less than 2% of all SCID cases. The AK2 gene encodes mitochondrial adenylate kinase 2 (Adenylate kinase 2, mitochondrial) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate group between ATP and AMP. It thus plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis, adenine nucleotide metabolism and regulation of phosphate utilization and AMP de novo biosynthesis. It also plays a key role in hematopoiesis.   Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the gene cause reticular dysgenesis. This condition presents at birth or early in the neonatal period, which is earlier than other forms of SCID. Presenting symptoms include signs of sepsis, growth failure, diarrhea, fever, recurrent infections (upper respiratory tract, oral candidiasis, perianal infections and abscesses) and bilateral sensorineural deafness. Despite recurrent infections, no significant lymphoid tissue or tonsillar tissue is evident. Hemoglobin  levels are within reference ranges at birth, but anemia develops over time secondary to sepsis and chronic illness. Hematologically, it is characterized by profound neutropenia and T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell lymphopenia. Deficiency of adenylate kinase 2 results in increased apoptosis of myeloid and lymphoid precursor cells. Before molecular techniques became available,  diagnosis was based on evidence of sensorineural deafness in combination with evidence of a marked reduction of T and NK cell counts when compared to age-matched healthy controls. Materno-fetal engraftment is usually present.  The only curative treatment for this disease is allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Without treatment, patients die from septicemia within days after birth.  The annual incidence of this form of SCID is estimated to be between 1/3,000,000 and 1/5,000,000 births. Both males and females are affected in this autosomal recessive condition.

GSDIa is more common than GSDIb, accounting for 80 percent of all GSDI cases.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Glycogen storage disease type 1a, caused by  pathogenic variants in the G6PC gene located on chromosome  17q21.31, is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic activity. Glucose 6-phosphatase catalyzes the terminal steps of both hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Since glucose 6-phosphate cannot be converted to glucose, defects in glucose 6-phosphatase result in conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to fat and glycogen.  Glycogen storage disease type I (also known as GSDI or von Gierke disease) is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of the complex sugar glycogen in the body's cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially the liver, kidneys, and small intestines, impairs their ability to function normally. Signs and symptoms of this condition typically appear around the age of 3 or 4 months, when babies start to sleep through the night and do not eat as frequently as newborns. Affected infants may have hypoglycemia, which can lead to seizures. They can also develop lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. As they get older, children with GSDI have thin arms and legs and short stature. An enlarged liver may give the appearance of a protruding abdomen. The kidneys may also be enlarged. Affected individuals may also have diarrhea and xanthomas. People with GSDI may experience delayed puberty. Beginning in young to mid-adulthood, affected individuals may develop osteoporosis, gout, kidney disease, and pulmonary hypertension. Females with this condition may also have polycystic ovaries. In affected teens and adults, adenomas may form in the liver. Adenomas are usually noncancerous (benign), but occasionally these tumors can become malignant.   Researchers have described two types of GSDI, which differ in their signs and symptoms and genetic cause. These types are known as glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) and glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb). Two other forms of GSDI have been described, and they were originally named types Ic and Id. However, these types are now known to be variations of GSDIb; for this reason, GSDIb is sometimes called GSD type I non-a. Many people with GSDIb develop neutropenia, which can make them prone to recurrent bacterial infections. Neutropenia is usually apparent by age 1.

The neutropenia and oral problems are specific to people with GSDIb and are typically not seen in people with GSDIa.", "Glycogen storage disease type I (also known as GSDI or von Gierke disease) is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of a complex sugar called glycogen in the body's cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially the liver, kidneys, and small intestines, impairs their ability to function normally.Signs and symptoms of this condition typically appear around the age of 3 or 4 months, when babies start to sleep through the night and do not eat as frequently as newborns. Affected infants may have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can lead to seizures. They can also have a buildup of lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis), high blood levels of a waste product called uric acid (hyperuricemia), and excess amounts of fats in the blood (hyperlipidemia). As they get older, children with GSDI have thin arms and legs and short stature. An enlarged liver may give the appearance of a protruding abdomen. The kidneys may also be enlarged. Affected individuals may also have diarrhea and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas).People with GSDI may experience delayed puberty. Beginning in young to mid-adulthood, affected individuals may have thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), a form of arthritis resulting from uric acid crystals in the joints (gout), kidney disease, and high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Females with this condition may also have abnormal development of the ovaries (polycystic ovaries). In affected teens and adults, tumors called adenomas may form in the liver. Adenomas are usually noncancerous (benign), but occasionally these tumors can become cancerous (malignant).Researchers have described two types of GSDI, which differ in their signs and symptoms and genetic cause. These types are known as glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) and glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb). Two other forms of GSDI have been described, and they were originally named types Ic and Id. However, these types are now known to be variations of GSDIb; for this reason, GSDIb is sometimes called GSD type I non-a.Many people with GSDIb have a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can make them prone to recurrent bacterial infections.

This gene provides instructions for making glucose 6-phosphate translocase which transports glucose 6-phosphate from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum. This transporter works in tandem with the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase to break down glucose 6-phosphate to glucose. Similarly to Glycogen Storage Disease type Ia (GSD1a), which is caused by a defect in glucose 6-phosphatase, defects in SLC37A4 result in conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to fat and glycogen. Unlike GSDIa, variants in SLC37A4 also result in neutropenia although the mechanism remains unclear.  Glycogen storage disease type I (also known as GSDI or von Gierke disease) is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of the complex sugar glycogen in the body's cells.

The incidence of this disorder varies among different ethnic groups.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Glycogen storage disease II (GSDII), also known as Pompe disease, is an autosomal recessive condition caused by pathogenic variants in the GAA gene located on chromosome 17q25.3. The GAA gene encodes acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase) which normally breaks down the complex sugar glycogen into the simpler sugar glucose. Deficiency of this enzyme results in accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes and lysosomal dysfunction.  Newborn screening for Pompe disease is on the HRSA recommended uniform screening panel as prompt initiation of enzyme replacement therapy can modify the course of the classic infantile-onset form of the disease. There is some genotype/phenotype correlation between identified pathogenic variants, along with CRIM (cross-reactive immunological material) status. An individual's CRIM status is an important predictor of the clinical response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). CRIM is the endogenous GAA protein produced by most patients with Pompe disease. CRIM negative means there is no residual GAA enzyme activity.  Pompe disease is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of glycogen in the body's cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially muscles, impairs their ability to function normally. Researchers have described three types of Pompe disease, which differ in severity and the age at which they appear. These types are known as classic infantile-onset, non-classic infantile-onset, and late-onset.  The classic form of infantile-onset Pompe disease begins within a few months of birth. Infants with this disorder typically experience muscle weakness (myopathy), poor muscle tone (hypotonia), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and heart defects/cardiomyopathy. Affected infants may also fail to thrive and have breathing problems. If untreated, this form of Pompe disease leads to death from heart failure in the first year of life. The non-classic form of infantile-onset Pompe disease usually appears by age 1. It is characterized by delayed motor skills (such as rolling over and sitting) and progressive muscle weakness. The heart may be abnormally large (cardiomegaly), but affected individuals usually do not experience heart failure. The muscle weakness in this disorder leads to serious breathing problems, and most children with non-classic infantile-onset Pompe disease live only into early childhood. The late-onset type of Pompe disease may not become apparent until later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Late-onset Pompe disease is usually milder than the infantile-onset forms of this disorder and is less likely to involve the heart. Most individuals with late-onset Pompe disease experience progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs and the trunk, including the muscles that control breathing. As the disorder progresses, breathing problems can lead to respiratory failure.  Treatment of Pompe disease is evolving. Currently, early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy for the classic infantile onset form can modify the course of the disease. For infants who are CRIM negative, immunosuppressive regimens are required to improve efficacy of treatment. Initiation of  enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease should be undertaken under the guidance of physicians with experience with the use of ERT and immunosuppression, when required.

This condition is also called epimerase deficiency galactosemia (GALE deficiency galactosemia).  Galactosemia is a disorder that affects how the body processes galactose. A small amount of galactose is present in many foods. It is primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy products and many baby formulas. The signs and symptoms of galactosemia result from an inability to use galactose to produce energy.  There are several forms of GALE deficiency galactosemia that are considered to be a continuum of disease. Generalized GALE deficiency occurs when enzyme activity is profoundly decreased in all tissues. Peripheral GALE deficiency occurs when enzyme activity is deficient in red blood cells and circulating white blood cells and near normal to normal in all other tissues. There is also an intermediate form, where enzyme activity is deficient in red blood cells and circulating white blood cells and less than 50% of normal levels in other cells tested.  It is unclear why the effects of some GALE mutations are restricted to blood cells, while other mutations affect all of the body's tissues and cause severe health problems    The signs and symptoms of galactosemia type III begin shortly after birth and can vary from mild to severe. These are caused by accumulation of toxic intermediates related to the interrupted catabolism of galactose. These can include cataracts, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, liver disease, and kidney problems. Infants with the generalized form develop clinical findings when on a diet that contains lactose and galactose. Symptoms include hypotonia, poor feeding, vomiting, weight loss, jaundice, hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, aminoaciduria, and cataracts. Prompt removal of galactose/lactose from the diet resolves or prevents these acute symptoms. Longer-term clinical features seen with the generalized form include short stature, developmental delays, sensorineural hearing loss and skeletal anomalies. Infants with the peripheral or intermediate forms usually remain clinically well, even on a regular milk diet, and may only be identified by biochemical testing. These individuals often do not require treatment.   Overall prevalence is not known but the disorder is thought to be very rare. Annual incidence is not known.

Patients with galactokinase deficiency have elevated plasma galactose levels and increased urinary excretion of galactitol.

Timely initiation of a galactose-restricted diet is important for the prevention and treatment of neonatal cataracts.

To function properly, these immature cells must differentiate into specific types of mature blood cells. By binding to DNA and interacting with other proteins, the GATA1 protein regulates the proliferation of immature red blood cells and platelet-precursor cells (megakaryocytes) to facilitate their differentiation. The GATA1 protein is also important for the maturation of several types of white blood cells that help fight infection, including eosinophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells.  Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a condition that affects blood cells and primarily occurs in males. A main feature of this condition is a type of anemia called dyserythropoietic anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells. The term dyserythropoietic refers to the abnormal red blood cell formation that occurs in this condition. In affected individuals, immature red blood cells are unusually shaped and cannot develop into functional mature cells, leading to a shortage of healthy red blood cells. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can also have a reduced level of circulating platelets (thrombocytopenia). Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. While people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have signs and symptoms of both blood disorders, some are primarily affected by anemia, while others are more affected by thrombocytopenia.

For many others, the signs and symptoms of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia begin in infancy. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or bruising after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Anemia can cause pale skin, weakness, and fatigue. Severe anemia may create a need for frequent blood transfusions to replenish the supply of red blood cells; however, repeated blood transfusions over many years can cause health problems such as excess iron in the blood. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia may also have a shortage of white blood cells neutropenia, which can make them prone to recurrent infections. Additionally, they may have splenomegaly. The severity of these abnormalities varies among affected individuals. Red blood cell transfusions are used to treat symptomatic anemia. Platelet transfusions can be used to treat active bleeding. Platelet aggregation studies should be done prior to transfusion, if  possible, to determine if DDAVP may be helpful. For individuals with thrombocytopenia and/or platelet aggregation defects, DDAVP treatment may be helpful for short-term management of mild to moderate bleeding.

Variants in GATA1 are a rare cause of Blackfan-Diamond anemia. Germline variants in this X-linked gene also cause the following conditions: X-linked anemia with or without neutropenia and/or platelet abnormalities, X-linked thrombocytopenia with beta-thalassemia and X-linked thrombocytopenia with or without dyserythropoietic anemia.  The GATA1 gene is located on the X-chromosome at Xp11.23. These conditions are inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion. The GATA1 gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in differentiation of immature red blood cells. By binding to DNA and interacting with other proteins, the GATA1 protein regulates the proliferation of immature red blood cells and megakaryocytes to facilitate their differentiation. The GATA1 protein is also important for the maturation of eosinophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells. Two versions of the GATA1 protein are produced from the GATA1 gene: a regular length protein and a shorter version- GATA1s. The GATA1s protein lacks the transactivation domain. Although the specific function of this region is unclear, it is believed that it interacts with other proteins to modify GATA1 protein function.  In Blackfan-Diamond anemia, the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Affected individuals have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia also have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and other cancers. Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical abnormalities that may include microcephaly; a low frontal hairline; hypertelorism; ptosis; a broad, flat nasal bridge; small, low-set ears; micrognathia; cleft palate +/- cleft lip; short, webbed neck; small, displaced scapulae; and malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature. Cataracts, glaucoma and strabismus have also been observed. Kidney and heart defects may be present, as well as hypospadias in males. The severity of Blackfan-Diamond anemia may vary, even within the same family. Increasingly, individuals with \"non-classical\" Blackfan-Diamond anemia have been identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms. For example, some affected individuals have mild anemia beginning later in childhood or in adulthood, while others have some of the physical features but no bone marrow problems.  The two main therapeutic approaches are regular transfusions and long-term corticosteroid therapy. Treatment must be adapted to each case and according to the age of the patient. Steroids should not be administered during the first year of life. Short stature, occurring both as part of the syndrome and due to treatment-related complications (steroids, hemochromatosis), is a major issue for these patients. Iron chelation therapy (desferoxamine, deferasirox) may be needed. Deferiprone is not recommended in the treatment of iron overload in individuals with Blackfan-Diamond anemia because its side effects include neutropenia. Allogenic bone-marrow transplantation should be discussed in corticosteroid-resistant patients.  The prognosis is generally good. However, complications of treatment and a higher incidence of cancer may reduce life expectancy. Disease severity depends on the quality and response to treatment. For patients undergoing regular transfusions, quality of life is clearly altered.  Blackfan-Diamond anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million newborn babies worldwide. The prevalence of cases related to variants in GATA1 is not known.

Overall, porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common type of porphyria. For some forms of porphyria, the prevalence is unknown because many people with a genetic mutation associated with the disease never experience signs or symptoms.Acute intermittent porphyria is the most common form of acute porphyria in most countries. It may occur more frequently in northern European countries, such as Sweden, and in the United Kingdom. Another form of the disorder, hereditary coproporphyria, has been reported mostly in Europe and North America. Variegate porphyria is most common in the Afrikaner population of South Africa; about 3 in 1,000 people in this population have the genetic change that causes this form of the disorder.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a rare genetic disorder caused by variants in either the UROS gene or GATA1. Mutations in GATA1 are a very rare cause of this condition. The GATA1 gene is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.23. In addition to being a rare cause of CEP, variants in this gene can also cause X-linked anemia with or without neutropenia and/or platelet abnormalities, X-linked thrombocytopenia with beta-thalassemia, and X-linked thrombocytopenia with or without dyserythropoietic anemia. The GATA1 gene encodes a zinc finger DNA-binding transcription factor that is involve in differentiation of hematopoietic cells including red blood cells, megakaryocytes, eosinophils, mast cells and dendritic cells. Two forms of GATA1 protein are produced: the regular length protein and a shorter version (GATA1s). It is thought that GATA1s, which lacks a transactivation domain, might interact with other proteins to modify GATA1 protein function.  The porphyrias are a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in heme production.  Several types of porphyrias have been identified and are distinguished by their genetic cause and clinical signs and symptoms. Cutaneous porphyrias primarily affect the skin; erythropoietic porphyrias cause hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly. CEP is both a cutaneous and erythropoietic porphyria. It is not completely clear how variants in GATA1 cause CEP. CEP results from deficient activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase. This enzyme is the fourth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. Deficiency of this enzyme results in overproduction of the non-physiological and pathogenic porphyrin isomers, uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is characterized by severe cutaneous photosensitivity with blistering and increased friability of the skin over light-exposed areas. Onset in most affected individuals occurs at birth or early infancy. Areas of skin exposed to the sun become fragile and blistered, which can lead to infection, scarring, deformities, and disfigurement of the light-exposed parts of the body such as hands, ears, nose, and eyelids. Less severe manifestations include changes in skin pigmentation, and increased hair growth. Hemolytic anemia is common in CEP and can range from mild to severe, with some affected individuals requiring chronic blood transfusions. In patients with CEP, porphyrin deposition may lead to corneal ulcers and scarring, erythrodontia (red discoloration of the teeth), and bone loss and/or expansion of the bone marrow.  There is a broad range of phenotypic presentation in CEP, from nonimmune hydrops fetalis in utero to late-onset disease with only mild cutaneous manifestations in adulthood.   There is currently no FDA approved treatment for this disease or specific treatment for the photosensitivity. Primary management is prevention of blistering by avoidance of sun and light exposure, including the long-wave ultraviolet light. This may include use of protective clothing, wraparound sunglasses, protective window films, reddish incandescent bulbs, filtering screens for fluorescent lights, and opaque sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium oxide. Skin care recommendations should be managed by a dermatologist, including the use of antiseptics to prevent bacterial colonization and infection. Wound care is necessary to prevent infection of opened blisters. Surgical intervention may be necessary.  Blood transfusions are necessary when hemolysis is significant. Bone marrow transplantation is the only cure for CEP and should be considered in children with severe disease.   Since its description at the end of the 19th century, about 200 cases  of CEP have been reported in the literature. The exact prevalence of GATA1-related CEP is unknown. Three patients have been reported in the literature.    ", "Porphyria is a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the chemical steps that lead to heme production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is a component of several iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).Researchers have identified several types of porphyria, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and their signs and symptoms. Some types of porphyria, called cutaneous porphyrias, primarily affect the skin. Areas of skin exposed to the sun become fragile and blistered, which can lead to infection, scarring, changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), and increased hair growth. Cutaneous porphyrias include congenital erythropoietic porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and porphyria cutanea tarda.Other types of porphyria, called acute porphyrias, primarily affect the nervous system. These disorders are described as acute because their signs and symptoms appear quickly and usually last a short time.  Episodes of acute porphyria can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea.  During an episode, a person may also experience muscle weakness, seizures, fever, and mental changes such as anxiety and hallucinations. These signs and symptoms can be life-threatening, especially if the muscles that control breathing become paralyzed. Acute porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria and ALAD deficiency porphyria. Two other forms of porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria, can have both acute and cutaneous symptoms.The porphyrias can also be split into erythropoietic and hepatic types, depending on where damaging compounds called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors first build up in the body. In erythropoietic porphyrias, these compounds originate in the bone marrow. Erythropoietic porphyrias include erythropoietic protoporphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Health problems associated with erythropoietic porphyrias include a low number of red blood cells (anemia) and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). The other types of porphyrias are considered hepatic porphyrias. In these disorders, porphyrins and porphyrin precursors originate primarily in the liver, leading to abnormal liver function and an increased risk of developing liver cancer.Environmental factors can strongly influence the occurrence and severity of signs and symptoms of porphyria. Alcohol, smoking, certain drugs, hormones, other illnesses, stress, and dieting or periods without food (fasting) can all trigger the signs and symptoms of some forms of the disorder. Additionally, exposure to sunlight worsens the skin damage in people with cutaneous porphyrias."], "alternate_names": ["ANEMIA, X-LINKED, WITH OR WITHOUT NEUTROPENIA AND/OR PLATELET ABNORMALITIES", "Congenital erythropoietic porphyria", "Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in Down syndrome", "Transient myeloproliferative syndrome", "Blackfan-Diamond anemia", "THROMBOCYTOPENIA, X-LINKED, WITH OR WITHOUT DYSERYTHROPOIETIC ANEMIA", "Acute basophilic leukemia"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 4170.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "GATA1"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Photodynamic therapy"}, {"int_description_2": "Plasmapheresis"}, {"int_description_3": "Prednisone", "timeframe_int3": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int3": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int3": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug3": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug3": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_4": "Hydroxychloroquine"}, {"int_description_5": "Vitamin D"}, {"int_description_6": "Hematin"}, {"int_description_7": "Hydroxyurea"}, {"int_description_8": "Deferasirox"}, {"int_description_9": "Bisphosphonates"}, {"int_description_10": "Bleach baths"}, {"int_description_11": "Activated charcoal"}, {"int_description_12": "Hypochlorous acid"}, {"int_description_13": "Intravenous antibiotics and long-term oral antibiotic"}, {"int_description_14": "Skin antiseptics"}, {"int_description_15": "Sunscreen lotions containing zinc oxide or titanium oxide", "timeframe_int15": "Days or Weeks,Years", "age_use_int15": "Infant,Child", "contra_int15": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug15": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug15": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_16": "Topical antibiotics"}, {"int_description_17": "Blood transfusions", "timeframe_int17": "Hours", "age_use_int17": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int17": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug17": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug17": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_18": "Skin trauma should avoiding"}, {"int_description_19": "Sun avoidance and skin protection"}, {"int_description_20": "Wraparound sun glasses"}, {"int_description_21": "Bone marrow transplantation"}, {"int_description_22": "Corrective surgery of the eyelid"}, {"int_description_23": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "timeframe_int23": "Days or Weeks,Years", "age_use_int23": "Infant,Child", "contra_int23": "Yes", "qualscale_reclass_drug23": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug23": "Curative"}, {"int_description_24": "Splenectomy", "timeframe_int24": "Days or Weeks,Years", "age_use_int24": "Child", "contra_int24": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug24": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug24": "Effective / Ameliorative"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: Recent advances.", "pmid_1": 30685241.0, "pmid_date_1": 2019.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Mol Genet Metab"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Congenital erythropoietic porphyria linked to GATA1-R216W mutation: challenges for diagnosis.", "pmid_2": 25251786.0, "pmid_date_2": 2015.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Eur J Haematol"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Congenital erythropoietic porphyria due to a mutation in GATA1: the first trans-acting mutation causative for a human porphyria.", "pmid_3": 17148589.0, "pmid_date_3": 2007.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Blood"}]}, {"_id": "4173-OMIM:187500", "condition": {"condition_name": "TETRALOGY OF FALLOT; TOF", "freq_per_birth": "Heart defects are the most common type of birth defect, accounting for more than 30 percent of all infant deaths due to birth defects.

Some of the heart defects involve structures within the heart itself, such as the two lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) or the valves that control blood flow through the heart. Others affect the structure of the large blood vessels leading into and out of the heart (including the aorta and pulmonary artery). Still others involve a combination of these structural abnormalities.People with CCHD have one or more specific heart defects. The heart defects classified as CCHD include coarctation of the aorta, double-outlet right ventricle, D-transposition of the great arteries, Ebstein anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, single ventricle, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus."], "alternate_names": ["CONOTRUNCAL HEART MALFORMATIONS; CTHM", "HEART DEFECTS, CONGENITAL, AND OTHER CONGENITAL ANOMALIES; HDCA", "ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 9; ASD9", "TETRALOGY OF FALLOT; TOF"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 4174.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "GATA6"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Insulin human"}, {"int_description_2": "Pancreatic enzyme replacement  monotherapy"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "GATA6 mutations: Characterization of two novel patients and a comprehensive overview of the GATA6 genotypic and phenotypic spectrum.", "pmid_1": 31301121.0, "pmid_date_1": 2019.0, "pmid_journal_1": "American journal of medical genetics.

The GLRA1 gene is located on chromosome 5q33, GLRB is located on 4q32.1 and SLC6A5 is located on 11p15.1. The GLRA1 gene encodes the alpha (\u03b1)1 subunit of the glycine receptor protein. The glycine receptor, which is composed of 5 subunits (two \u03b11 subunits and three beta (\u03b2) subunits)  is embedded in the membrane of neurons in the spinal cord and the brainstem. The glycine receptor acts as an inhibitory receptor by binding glycine which causes an influx of negatively charged chlorine ions into the neuron, resulting in inhibition of signal transmission.  HPX is an inherited (both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive) neuronal disorder caused by genetic defects leading to dysfunction of glycinergic inhibitory transmission; it is characterized by the clinical core features of exaggerated startle responses to unexpected sensory stimuli and stiffness.  Affected infants have increased muscle tone (hypertonia) and an exaggerated startle reaction to unexpected stimuli, especially loud noises. Following the startle reaction, infants experience a brief period in which they are very rigid and unable to move. During these rigid periods, some infants stop breathing, which, if prolonged, can be fatal. Infants with hereditary hyperekplexia have hypertonia at all times, except when they are sleeping. Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hyperekplexia can include muscle twitches when falling asleep (hypnagogic myoclonus) and movements of the arms or legs while asleep. Some infants, when tapped on the nose, extend their head forward and have spasms of the limb and neck muscles. Rarely, infants with hereditary hyperekplexia experience recurrent seizures (epilepsy).The signs and symptoms of hereditary hyperekplexia typically fade by age 1. However, older individuals with hereditary hyperekplexia may still startle easily and have periods of rigidity, which can cause them to fall. They may also continue to have hypnagogic myoclonus or movements during sleep. As they get older, individuals with this condition may have a low tolerance for crowded places and loud noises. People with hereditary hyperekplexia who have epilepsy have the seizure disorder throughout their lives.  Individuals with GLRB-HPX or SLC6A5-HPX are more likely to have developmental delay than those with GLRA1-HPX, whereas 92% of individuals reported with GLRB-HPX are reported to have mild-to-severe delay in speech acquisition. Children with SLC6A5-HPX are significantly more likely to have  recurrent infantile apnea than those with GLRA1-HPX. Individuals with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of HPX typically are not dysmorphic and brain imaging reveals a structurally normal brain.  In both infants and adults, hyperekplexia is treated most effectively with the anti-anxiety and anti-spastic drug clonazepam. Other drugs that may be used, but are not considered first line therapy,  include carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, diazepam, 5-hydroxytryptophan, piracetam, and sodium valproate.

It plays an important role in regulating amino acid-induced insulin secretion.   Congenital hyperinsulinism is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition that causes individuals to secrete abnormally high levels of insulin. People with this condition have frequent hypoglycemic episodes. In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by lethargy, irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated hypoglycemic episodes increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma. FHH6 typically presents in late infancy as protein-induced hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia. Insulin secretion is triggered by allosteric activation of the enzyme by leucine. FHH6 is diet and/or diazoxide-responsive.  Congenital hyperinsulinism affects approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns. This condition is more common in certain populations, affecting up to 1 in 2,500 newborns.

People with this condition have frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating."], "alternate_names": ["HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6; HHF6"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 4335.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "GLUD1"}, "interventions":

GRIN2 encodes a protein known as GluN2A (NR2A). This protein is found in neurons in the brain (including regions involved in speech and language) and the spinal cord. GluN2A is a subunit of a subset of NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels. When glutamate and glycine bind to the receptor, the channel opens allowing passage of cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+) through, generating currents that activate neuron signaling and signaling cascades. Disruption of GRIN2 is associated with focal epilepsy and speech disorder with or without cognitive disability (FESD).   FESD is a childhood-onset seizure disorder with a highly variable phenotype. It is characterized by speech disorders in all affected individuals. Epilepsy syndromes present in about 90% of affected patients. Severe speech disorders can include dysarthria, speech dyspraxia, and both receptive and expressive language delay and/or regression. Less severely affected individuals may have subtly impaired intelligibility of conversational speech. Onset of seizures is usually between 3 and 6 years of age as focal epilepsy with language and/or global developmental regression. The electroencephalogram (EEG) shows continuous spike-and-wave discharges in sleep or very active centrotemporal discharges. Several seizure types may be seen, including seizures associated with aura of perioral paresthesia, focal or focal motor seizures that may evolve to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and atypical absence seizures. FESD is on the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum, a group of conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms. These syndromes have several names including Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ECSWS), childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS), atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS), autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD), and infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy.  The prevalence of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is unknown. Most of the conditions in the spectrum are rare; however, CECTS is one of the most common forms of epilepsy in children, accounting for 8 to 25 percent of cases. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 5,000 children younger than 16. The prevalence of GRIN2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder among individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or childhood-onset epilepsy is around 0.2%  ", "The epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is a group of conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms. A key feature of these conditions is impairment of language skills (aphasia). The language problems can affect speaking, reading, and writing. Another feature of epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorders is certain patterns of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which are detected by a test called an electroencephalogram (EEG). Many people with conditions in this spectrum develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and some have mild to severe intellectual disability. The conditions in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum, which all begin in childhood, include Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep syndrome (ECSWS), autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD), intermediate epilepsy-aphasia disorder (IEAD), atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS), and childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS).LKS and ECSWS are at the severe end of the spectrum. Both usually feature a characteristic abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the brain called continuous spike and waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS). This pattern occurs while the affected child is sleeping, specifically during deep (slow-wave) sleep.Most children with LKS develop normally in early childhood, although some speak later than their peers. However, affected children lose language skills beginning around age 5. This loss typically begins with verbal agnosia, which is the inability to understand speech. As LKS develops, the ability to express speech is also impaired. Approximately 70 percent of children with LKS have seizures, typically of a type described as focal (or partial) because the seizure activity occurs in specific regions of the brain rather than affecting the entire brain.About half of children with ECSWS develop normally in early childhood, while others have delayed development of speech and motor skills. Although children with ECSWS typically lose a range of previously acquired skills, including those involved in language, movement, learning, or behavior, not everyone with ECSWS has aphasia. Seizures occur in approximately 80 percent of children with ECSWS and can include a variety of types, such as atypical absence seizures, which involve short periods of staring blankly; hemiclonic seizures, which cause rhythmic jerking of one side of the body; or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which cause stiffening and rhythmic jerking of the entire body.CECTS is at the mild end of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Affected children have rolandic seizures; these seizures are triggered by abnormal activity in an area of the brain called the rolandic region, which is part of the cerebrum. The seizures, which usually occur during sleep, cause twitching, numbness, or tingling of the face or tongue, often causing drooling and impairing speech. In most people with CECTS, the seizures disappear by the end of adolescence. Most affected individuals develop normally, although some have difficulty coordinating the movements of the mouth and tongue needed for clear speech (dyspraxia) or impairment of language skills.The other conditions in the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum are less common and fall in the middle of the spectrum. Children with IEAD usually have delayed development or regression of language skills. Some have seizures and most have abnormal electrical activity in their brains during sleep, although it is not prominent enough to be classified as CSWS. ACECTS features seizures and developmental regression that can affect movement, language, and attention. Children with ACECTS have abnormal electrical activity in the brain that is sometimes classified as CSWS.

The features of MPS VII include a large head (macrocephaly), a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), distinctive-looking facial features that are described as coarse, and a large tongue (macroglossia). Affected individuals also frequently develop an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), heart valve abnormalities, and a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or lower abdomen (inguinal hernia). The airway may become narrow in some people with MPS VII, leading to frequent upper respiratory infections and short pauses in breathing during sleep (sleep apnea).

The HCFC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called HCF-1, that helps regulate the activity of other genes. HCF-1 interacts with proteins called transcription factors, which bind to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity of particular genes. A specific function of the HCF-1 protein is to control the activity of genes involved in the processing of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), particularly the MMACHC gene. MMACHC plays a critical role in the conversion of vitamin B12 into both adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is a cofactor required for proper functioning of methylmalonyl CoA mutase, an enzyme necessary for breaking down the amino acids isoleucine and valine, lipids, and cholesterol.  MeCbl is a cofactor required for the proper functioning of methionine synthase. This enzyme converts the amino acid homocysteine to methionine which is used to make other proteins and other important compounds. HCF-1 is also important in the regulation of the cell cycle and in the distribution of cells in developing tissues and organs, including the brain.  Methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia, cblX type, is an X-linked recessive metabolic disorder characterized by severely delayed psychomotor development apparent in the neonatal period and infancy. It is associated with failure to thrive, cognitive impairment, and intractable epilepsy.  There is no cure for cblX. Acute treatment includes volume replacement with isotonic solutions containing high (10%-12.5%) glucose to reverse catabolism which should also be used for patients with reduced oral intake. Fasting should be avoided. Individuals with methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria may respond to a combined treatment strategy including dietary management along with supplementation of nutrients, such as hydroxycobalamin, betaine, folic acid, vitamin B6 and L-carnitine.

Pathogenic variants in HESX1 located on chromosome 3p14.3 have been found to cause some cases of Septo-optic Dysplasia. The condition can be caused by either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in the HESX1 gene. Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity have been reported. This gene encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the family of homeobox genes. These genes act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures. HEXS1 plays a role in control of early brain development. It is essential for the formation of the pituitary gland. It also plays a critical role in the development of forebrain structures, including the optic nerves.  Septo-optic dysplasia is a disorder of early brain development. Although its signs and symptoms vary, this condition is traditionally defined by three characteristic features: optic nerve hypoplasia, abnormal formation of structures along the midline of the brain, and pituitary hypoplasia. The first major feature, optic nerve hypoplasia, is the underdevelopment of the optic nerves, which carry visual information from the eyes to the brain. In affected individuals, the optic nerves are abnormally small and make fewer connections than usual between the eyes and the brain. As a result, people with optic nerve hypoplasia have impaired vision in one or both eyes. Optic nerve hypoplasia can also be associated with nystagmus and other eye abnormalities. The second characteristic feature of SOD is the abnormal development of structures separating the right and left halves of the brain, including the corpus callosum and the septum pellucidum. In the early stages of brain development, these structures may form abnormally or fail to develop at all. Depending on which structures are affected, abnormal brain development can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems. The third major feature of this disorder is pituitary hypoplasia. Underdevelopment of the pituitary can lead to pituitary hormone deficiencies. Most commonly, pituitary hypoplasia causes growth hormone deficiency, which results in slow growth and unusually short stature. Severe cases cause panhypopituitarism. Panhypopituitarism is associated with slow growth, hypoglycemia, genital abnormalities, and problems with sexual development. The signs and symptoms of SOD can vary significantly. It has been suggested that SOD should actually be considered a group of related conditions rather than a single disorder. About one-third of people diagnosed with SOD have all three major features; most affected individuals have two of the major features. In rare cases, SOD is associated with additional signs and symptoms, including epilepsy, delayed development, and abnormal movements.  Septo-optic dysplasia has an incidence of 1 in 10000 live births and is associated with younger maternal age. In most cases of SOD, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Researchers suspect that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may play a role in causing this disorder. A genetic diagnosis is made in <1% of patients. The prevalence of SOD caused by mutations in HESX1 is unknown  ", "Septo-optic dysplasia is a disorder of early brain development.

These structures include the corpus callosum, which is a band of tissue that connects the two halves of the brain, and the septum pellucidum, which separates the fluid-filled spaces called ventricles in the brain. In the early stages of brain development, these structures may form abnormally or fail to develop at all. Depending on which structures are affected, abnormal brain development can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems.The third major feature of this disorder is pituitary hypoplasia. The pituitary is a gland at the base of the brain that produces several hormones. These hormones help control growth, reproduction, and other critical body functions. Underdevelopment of the pituitary can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of many essential hormones. Most commonly, pituitary hypoplasia causes growth hormone deficiency, which results in slow growth and unusually short stature.

The CFH gene provides instructions for making complement factor H. This protein helps regulate the complement system. The complement system, or complement cascade, is a part of the immune system that 'complements' the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells, promote inflammation  and attack a pathogen's cell membrane. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not damage the body's healthy cells. Complement factor H, together with several related proteins, protects healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed. In addition to causing autosomal dominant and recessive Susceptibility to Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome 1, variants in the CFH gene can cause Basal Laminar Drusen, autosomal dominant and recessive Complement factor H deficiency (which may present as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 2 (dense deposit disease) or glomerulonephritis with isolated C3 deposits) and Age-related Macular Degeneration 4.  Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal thrombus formation in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. Hemolytic anemia can lead to pallor, jaundice, fatigue, dyspnea and tachycardia. Thrombocytopenia can result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. Clot formation in the kidney can result in kidney damage and acute kidney failure that can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD occurs in about half of cases of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. More than 100 mutations in the CFH gene have been identified in people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Mutations in this gene increase the risk of a severe form of the disorder that usually appears in childhood.  Most CFH gene mutations associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome affect the C-terminal domain of complement factor H. This results in complement factor H deficiency, that can result in uncontrolled activation of the complement cascade. Although changes in the CFH gene increase the risk of developing atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, they are often not sufficient to cause the disease. In people with CFH gene mutations, the signs and symptoms of the disorder may be triggered by factors such as certain medications (such as anti-cancer drugs), chronic diseases, viral or bacterial infections, cancers, organ transplantation, or pregnancy.  Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which is much more common. The two disorders have different causes and different signs and symptoms. Unlike the atypical form, the typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce Shiga-like toxins. The typical form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger than 10. The typical form is less likely than the atypical form to involve recurrent attacks of kidney damage that lead to ESRD.  Treatment of atypical hemolytic syndrome includes blood transfusions, plasma exchange/plasma infusion,  dialysis if indicated, and blood pressure control. Patients on dialysis may develop malignant hypertension, and bilateral nephrectomy may be needed to achieve blood pressure control in some patients. Eculizumab is becoming standard of care, particularly when the diagnosis of aHUS is more certain (identified pathogenic variant in an associated gene, a non-simultaneous family history of HUS, recurrent HUS, or hypocomplementemia at presentation).Plasma exchange/infusion is used to replace absent or abnormally functioning CFH.  The incidence of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 500,000 people per year in the United States. The atypical form is probably about 10 times less common than the typical form. The prevalence of factor H deficiency is felt to be about 1-9/1,000,000.  Factor H deficiency has been found to be the underlying basis for 15% to 30% of patients with atypical HUS.

Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure.Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate.Thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cells that normally assist with blood clotting. In people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream because a large number of platelets are used to make abnormal clots. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases.

That caused by CFHR1 usually results from an 83 kb deletion that includes CFHR1 and CFHR3. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. The human CFHR-Factor H gene cluster encodes five complement factor H-related (CFHR) proteins that are complement and immune modulators and  two complement regulators, Factor H and FHL1 (factor H-like protein 1). Genetic and chromosomal alterations in this cluster are associated with susceptibility to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and C3 glomerulopathy. The human Factor H-CFHR gene cluster is located on chromosome 1q32 in a region known as the regulators of complement activation region. The five CFHR genes are located downstream from the Factor H gene and are arranged in the order CFHR3, CFHR1, CFHR4, CFHR2, and CFHR5. This cluster is a hotspot for structural rearrangements. Familial or de novo modifications that result in copy number variations (deletions, duplications),  generate heterozygous CFHR gene variants and fusion proteins that predispose individuals to developing atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  (aHUS). Various structural genetic alterations result in the expression of mutant and altered FHR proteins ( FHR::Factor H and Factor H::FHR hybrid proteins). These modified FHR proteins, together with an altered FHR and Factor H plasma repertoire, are thought to modify complement activity, and, in some cases, cause morphologic changes in the glomerulus. The CFHR genes are transcribed in the liver while the proteins are distributed in plasma. CFHR1, CFHR3, and Factor H gene alterations combined with intact CFHR2, CFHR4, and CFHR5 genes are reported in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. These modified proteins influence complement function and interactions of the five FHR proteins with each other and with Factor H.

Clot formation in small blood vessels can cause kidney damage and acute kidney failure. In about half of all cases, this leads to end-stage renal disease.  Treatment of CHFR1 aHUS is complex. Eculizumab should be considered as a first-line therapy when the diagnosis of aHUS is unequivocal, since this treatment has the potential to rescue renal function when administered early after onset of the disease. Plasma exchange therapy may be used if eculizumab is not available. Combination therapy has also been used. ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists help to reduce renal disease progression to end-stage renal failure, while at the same time controlling blood pressure. Bilateral nephrectomy may serve as rescue therapy in selected individuals with extensive microvascular thrombosis at renal biopsy, refractory hypertension, and signs of hypertensive encephalopathy, in whom conventional therapies do not control the disease. Kidney transplantation (or combined liver and kidney transplantation) may be considered although disease may recur. Treatment with steroids (or other immunosuppressants) may be necessary as auto-antibodies have been reported with CFHR1 deletion. Persons with anti-CFH autoantibodies benefit from this treatment, often in conjunction with plasma exchange.  The incidence of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 500,000 people per year in the United States. The atypical form is probably about 10 times less common than the typical form. Of the atypical form, approximately 26.5% of cases have been attributed to CFHR3/CHFR1 deletions (heterozygous and homozygous) while 3-5% of cases have been attributed to CFH/CFHR1 hybrid alleles. Fewer cases have been associated with CFHR1/CFH hybrid alleles and CFHR1/CFHR4 deletions.  ", "Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function.

This gene, located on chromosome 7q36.3, encodes a nuclear protein highly expressed in the colon, small intestine, duodenum, pancreas and testis, that functions as a transcription factor. Mutations in MNX1 result in an autosomal dominant congenital malformation syndrome, caused by loss of function of the transcription factor,  that is most commonly characterized by a sickle shaped sacrum/partial sacral agenesis, anal atresia and a pre-sacral mass or tumor (meningocele, teratoma or hamartoma). The majority of cases are familial, while about 30% of cases are \"sporadic\" or isolated.  The most common presenting symptom is bowel obstruction in infancy or chronic constipation in childhood. Perianal sepsis, identified in at least 10% of patients, often indicates the presence of an underlying presacral mass or teratoma. Gynecological and renal malformations are also common, occurring in 19% and 35% of cases, respectively. Hirschsprung disease has also been reported. Rarer complications include pelvic abscesses, malignant degeneration of presacral teratomas, E. coli ascending meningitis and spinal cord tethering. Benign teratomas have been reported to recur. Urinary incontinence, and poor sphincter control have also been reported. Later complications may include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, sacral anesthesia and headaches precipitated by coughing or straining.   As with other dominantly inherited conditions, there is phenotypic variability. Three categories of Currarino syndrome are recognized, according to the severity of the disease: (1) complete CS: anorectal malformations (ARMs), presacral mass and sacral anomalies; (2) mild CS: sacral anomaly associated with one of the other two malformations (ARMs or presacral mass); and (3) minimal CS: sacral anomalies alone. It has been reported that approximately 50% of those who inherit a mutation in MNX1 present with the severe phenotype and require surgery. Approximately 25% have milder symptoms and up to 1/3 of individuals with pathogenic variants are asymptomatic.  Treatment depends on the type and severity of abnormalities present. This may include treatment with antibiotics for infection or prophylaxis, use of laxatives for chronic constipation or intermittent catherization for bladder dysfunction. Surgical interventions may include anorectoplasty, presacral mass excision or detethering of tethered spinal cord. Specific surgical approaches are best guided by pediatric surgeon and neurosurgeon expertise and experience.  The prevalence of CS is about 1\u2009~\u20099/100,000  worldwide.

The HMGCL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMG-CoA lyase). This enzyme is found in mitochondria. HMG-CoA lyase plays a critical role in breaking down proteins and fats from the diet. Specifically, it is responsible for processing the essential amino acid leucine. HMG-CoA lyase also produces ketones during the breakdown of fats. Ketones are compounds that certain organs and tissues, particularly the brain, use for energy when the simple sugar glucose is not available. Ketones are important sources of energy during periods of fasting.  HMG-CoA lyase deficiency is an uncommon inherited disorder in which the body cannot properly process leucine. Additionally, the disorder prevents the body from making ketones, which are compounds that are used for energy during fasting. The signs and symptoms of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency usually appear within the first year of life. The condition causes episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, lethargy, and hypotonia. During an episode, blood sugar levels can become dangerously low (hypoglycemia), and a buildup of harmful compounds can cause the blood to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis). If untreated, the disorder can lead to breathing problems, convulsions, coma, and death. Episodes are often triggered by an infection, fasting, strenuous exercise, or other types of stress.  Evidence-based treatment of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency has not been established. The majority of reported patients are on a  low-fat, low-protein diet. Some are maintained on a low leucine diet, although there is not enough evidence to conclude that a special diet is necessary. Levo-carnitine is often provided to prevent carnitine deficiency, although there are no results from controlled studies so no conclusions can be drawn with respect to carnitine supplementation. Administration of carnitine may have detoxifying effects and help to avoid secondary carnitine deficiency and intracellular depletion of free CoA. In one review of cases and management, 78% of patients received carnitine supplementation. Fasting should be avoided and IV dextrose should be provided if affected individuals are ill and have inadequate oral intake or if fasting is required (i.e., pre-operatively, intra-operatively and  post-operatively).

These forms of diabetes typically begin before age 30, although they can occur later in life. In MODY, elevated blood sugar arises from reduced production of insulin, which is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Specifically, insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells, where it is used as an energy source.The different types of MODY are distinguished by their genetic causes. The most common types are HNF1A-MODY (also known as MODY3), accounting for 50 to 70 percent of cases, and GCK-MODY (MODY2), accounting for 30 to 50 percent of cases. Less frequent types include HNF4A-MODY (MODY1) and renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome (also known as HNF1B-MODY or MODY5), which each account for 5 to 10 percent of cases. At least ten other types have been identified, and these are very rare.HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY have similar signs and symptoms that develop slowly over time. Early signs and symptoms in these types are caused by high blood sugar and may include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, weight loss, and recurrent skin infections. Over time uncontrolled high blood sugar can damage small blood vessels in the eyes and kidneys. Damage to the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) causes a condition known as diabetic retinopathy that can lead to vision loss and eventual blindness. Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While these two types of MODY are very similar, certain features are particular to each type. For example, babies with HNF4A-MODY tend to weigh more than average or have abnormally low blood sugar at birth, even though other signs of the condition do not occur until childhood or young adulthood. People with HNF1A-MODY have a higher-than-average risk of developing noncancerous (benign) liver tumors known as hepatocellular adenomas.GCK-MODY is a very mild type of the condition. People with this type have slightly elevated blood sugar levels, particularly in the morning before eating (fasting blood sugar). However, affected individuals often have no symptoms related to the disorder, and diabetes-related complications are extremely rare.RCAD is associated with a combination of diabetes and kidney or urinary tract abnormalities (unrelated to the elevated blood sugar), most commonly fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in the kidneys. However, the signs and symptoms are variable, even within families, and not everyone with RCAD has both features.

Disruption of HNF4A activity interrupts gene transcription, altering gene activity and ultimately resulting in abnormal beta cell function with altered insulin production/release. HNF4A mutations cause a range of phenotypes including congenital hyperinsulinism (diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism) and Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). The main clinical characteristics of FRTS4 range from mild transient hypoglycemia limited to the neonatal period to severe, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Other clinical features may include macrosomia, short stature, increased birth weight and rarely, hepatomegaly. Additionally, renal proximal tubular dysfunction along with nephrocalcinosis, rickets and metabolic acidosis due to renal bicarb loss can be present. Age of onset for hypoglycemia is typically in the neonatal period. Renal dysfunction tends to develop in early childhood. Some patients develop diabetes mellitus in adolescence.    The mainstay of treatment for this condition is provision of IV glucose to prevent hypoglycemia and diazoxide (most are diazoxide-responsive in infancy with decreased need over time). Need for IV glucose/dextrose may be transient, but is standard of care for hypoglycemia.  Diazoxide is a potassium channel activator that inhibits insulin release from the pancreas by opening K+ channels in the beta cell membrane. Chlorothiazide may be co-administered to prevent fluid retention.  Provision of calcium and cholecalciferol may be necessary if hypocalcemia and rickets develop secondary to renotubular calcium losses. As patients mature, hypoglycemia may resolve and diabetes mellitus may develop.  This is a rare condition. The exact prevalence is unknown, although it is considered to be the third most common genetic cause of diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism.

Variants in this gene also cause Fanconi Renotubular Syndrome 4 With Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young and Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young, Type 1. The HNF4A gene encodes HNF-4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha), a transcription factor that has a key role in regulating the multiple transcriptional factor networks in the islet and, in combination with other hepatocyte nuclear factors (such as HNF-1alpha) form a functional regulatory loop in the adult pancreatic beta-cell. HNF-4-alpha binds to the promoters of 11% of islet genes. Thus HNF-4alpha deficiency probably exhibits its phenotype via abnormal expression of one or more of these target islet genes.  The condition presents as neonatal hypoglycemia. The manifestations range from mild transient hypoglycemia, limited to the neonatal period to severe and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Macrosomia is common, with mutation carriers having an increased birth weight by a median of 790 grams. Patients are at increased risk of developing MODY syndrome in later life. All patients are responsive to medical management with diazoxide. Family history of diabetes is usually, but not always present.  The mainstay of treatment for this condition is provision of IV glucose to prevent hypoglycemia and diazoxide (most are diazoxide-responsive in infancy with decreased need over time). Need for IV glucose/dextrose may be transient, but is standard of care for hypoglycemia.  Diazoxide is a potassium channel activator that inhibits insulin release from the pancreas by opening K+ channels in the beta cell membrane. Chlorothiazide is often co-administered with diazoxide to prevent fluid retention.  Although exact prevalence is unknown, HNF4A mutations are presumably the third most common genetic cause of diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism.

The gonads direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. The adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys, regulate the production of certain hormones and control salt levels in the body. People with 3\u03b2-HSD deficiency lack many of the hormones that are made in these glands. 3\u03b2-HSD deficiency is one of a group of disorders known as congenital adrenal hyperplasias that impair hormone production and disrupt sexual development and maturation.There are three types of 3\u03b2-HSD deficiency: the salt-wasting, non-salt-wasting, and non-classic types. In the salt-wasting type, hormone production is extremely low. Individuals with this type lose large amounts of sodium in their urine, which can be life-threatening. Individuals affected with the salt-wasting type are usually diagnosed soon after birth due to complications related to a lack of salt reabsorption, including dehydration, poor feeding, and vomiting. People with the non-salt-wasting type of 3\u03b2-HSD deficiency produce enough hormone to allow sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. Individuals with the non-classic type have the mildest symptoms and do not experience salt wasting.In males with any type of 3\u03b2-HSD deficiency, problems with male sex hormones lead to abnormalities of the external genitalia. These abnormalities range from having the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) to having external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia). The severity of the genital abnormality does not consistently depend on the type of the condition. Because of the hormone dysfunction in the testes, males with 3\u03b2-HSD deficiency are frequently unable to have biological children (infertile).Females with 3\u03b2-HSD deficiency may have slight abnormalities of the external genitalia at birth. Females affected with the non-salt-wasting or non-classic types are typically not diagnosed until mid-childhood or puberty, when they may experience irregular menstruation, premature pubic hair growth, and excessive body hair growth (hirsutism). Females with 3\u03b2-HSD deficiency have difficulty conceiving a child (impaired fertility)."], "alternate_names": ["ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 3-BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE 2 DEFICIENCY"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 5218.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "HSD3B2"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Rehydration", "timeframe_int1": "Hours", "age_use_int1": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int1": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug1": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug1": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_2": "Fludrocortisone", "timeframe_int2": "Hours", "age_use_int2": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int2": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug2": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug2": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_3": "Hydrocortisone", "timeframe_int3": "Hours", "age_use_int3": "Neonate", "qualscale_reclass_drug3": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug3": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_4": "Long-term glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement"}, {"int_description_5": "Sex steroid replacement therapy"}, {"int_description_6": "Adrenal crisis management"}, {"int_description_7": "Correction of hypoglycemia"}, {"int_description_8": "Genitoplasty"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Clinical perspectives in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency.", "pmid_1": 30719691.0, "pmid_date_1": 2019.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Endocrine"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Human 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency associated with normal spermatic numeration despite a severe enzyme deficit.", "pmid_2": 29420188.0, "pmid_date_2": 2018.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Endocr Connect"}]}, {"_id": "5391-OMIM:607014", "condition": {"condition_name": "HURLER SYNDROME", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a condition that affects many parts of the body. This disorder was once divided into three separate syndromes: Hurler syndrome (MPS I-H), Hurler-Scheie syndrome (MPS I-H/S), and Scheie syndrome (MPS I-S), listed from most to least severe. Because there is so much overlap among these three syndromes, MPS I is currently divided into the severe and attenuated types. MPS I is caused by variants in the IDUA gene, located on chromosome 4p16.3. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The IDUA gene provides instructions for producing alpha-L-iduronidase. This lysosomal enzyme is essential for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) which are large sugar molecules. Alpha-L-iduronidase hydrolyzes unsulfated alpha-L-iduronic acid, which is present in two GAGs - heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Deficiency of this enzyme results in accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate within lysosomes. Alpha-L-iduronidase activity is <1% for all forms of MPS1, thus activity level cannot differentiate between severe and attenuated forms. In general, MPS I-H and MPS I-S are considered to be more severe forms of the disease. Children with MPS I often have no obvious signs or symptoms of the condition at birth, although some have an umbilical or inguinal hernia. Those with severe MPS I generally begin to show other signs and symptoms of the disorder within the first year of life, while those with the attenuated form have milder features that develop later in childhood. In the past, MPS-HS was described as having onset of symptoms between 3-5 years of age and MPS-S with onset of symptoms after 5 years of age.  Individuals with MPS I may have macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, heart valve abnormalities, distinctive-looking facial features that are described as \"coarse,\" hepatosplenomegaly, and macroglossia. Vocal cords can also enlarge, resulting in a deep, hoarse voice. The airway may become narrow in many individuals with MPS I, causing frequent upper respiratory infections and obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is also common. Other common features include corneal clouding (which can affect vision), recurrent ear infections and hearing loss (both conductive and sensorineural).  Short stature and contractures are common. The latter may affect mobility. Most people with the severe form of the disorder also have dysostosis multiplex. Contractures of the fingers are common. Carpal tunnel syndrome develops in many children with this disorder and is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. Cervical spine stenosis can compress and damage the spinal cord. A gibbus deformity of the lumbar spine often develops.  While both forms of MPS I can affect many different organs and tissues, individuals with severe MPS I experience a decline in intellectual function and a more rapid disease progression. Developmental delay is usually present by age 1, and severely affected individuals eventually developmentally regress. Children with this form of the disorder usually have a shortened lifespan, sometimes living only into late childhood. Individuals with attenuated MPS I typically live into adulthood and may or may not have a shortened lifespan. Some people with the attenuated type have learning disabilities, while others have no intellectual impairments. Heart disease and airway obstruction are major causes of death in people with both types of MPS I.  There is no cure for MPS I. Management requires a multidisciplinary team given the wide range of symptoms. This team may include metabolism (biochemical genetics); primary care; cardiology; pulmonology; gastroenterology; neurology; ear, nose, and throat specialists; audiology; ophthalmology; orthopedics; physical therapy; dental; and developmental specialists. The two main treatment options for MPS I include hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Both treatments work by replacing the missing alpha-L-iduronidase.  HSCT is considered standard of care for individuals with severe MPS I; however, its success is dependent on timing of treatment. It is typically recommended that HSCT occur early in the disease process, prior to two years of age. HSCT can improve facial, auditory, and cardiac manifestations. The effect on intellectual development is unclear with some studies suggesting an improvement, while others report a slowing of cognitive decline. Laronidase  is the enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I. Treatment with laronidase can improve problems with breathing, growth, the bones, joints and heart. However, laronidase does not cross the blood brain barrier and thus, has no effect on intellectual development.   Severe MPS I occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns. Attenuated MPS I is less common and occurs in about 1 in 500,000 newborns.

I (MPS I) is a condition that affects many parts of the body. This disorder was once divided into three separate syndromes: Hurler syndrome (MPS I-H), Hurler-Scheie syndrome (MPS I-H/S), and Scheie syndrome (MPS I-S), listed from most to least severe. Because there is so much overlap among these three syndromes, MPS I is currently divided into the severe and attenuated types. MPS I is caused by variants in the IDUA gene, located on chromosome 4p16.3. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The IDUA gene provides instructions for producing alpha-L-iduronidase. This lysosomal enzyme is essential for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) which are large sugar molecules. Alpha-L-iduronidase hydrolyzes unsulfated alpha-L-iduronic acid, which is present in two GAGs - heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Deficiency of this enzyme results in accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate within lysosomes. Alpha-L-iduronidase activity is <1% for all forms of MPS1, thus activity level cannot differentiate between severe and attenuated forms. In general, MPS I-H and MPS I-S are considered to be more severe forms of the disease. Children with MPS I often have no obvious signs or symptoms of the condition at birth, although some have an umbilical or inguinal hernia. Those with severe MPS I generally begin to show other signs and symptoms of the disorder within the first year of life, while those with the attenuated form have milder features that develop later in childhood. In the past, MPS-HS was described as having onset of symptoms between 3-5 years of age and MPS-S with onset of symptoms after 5 years of age.  Individuals with MPS I may have macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, heart valve abnormalities, distinctive-looking facial features that are described as \"coarse,\" hepatosplenomegaly, and macroglossia. Vocal cords can also enlarge, resulting in a deep, hoarse voice. The airway may become narrow in many individuals with MPS I, causing frequent upper respiratory infections and obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is also common. Other common features include corneal clouding (which can affect vision), recurrent ear infections and hearing loss (both conductive and sensorineural).  Short stature and contractures are common. The latter may affect mobility. Most people with the severe form of the disorder also have dysostosis multiplex. Contractures of the fingers are common. Carpal tunnel syndrome develops in many children with this disorder and is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. Cervical spine stenosis can compress and damage the spinal cord. A gibbus deformity of the lumbar spine often develops.  While both forms of MPS I can affect many different organs and tissues, individuals with severe MPS I experience a decline in intellectual function and a more rapid disease progression. Developmental delay is usually present by age 1, and severely affected individuals eventually developmentally regress. Children with this form of the disorder usually have a shortened lifespan, sometimes living only into late childhood. Individuals with attenuated MPS I typically live into adulthood and may or may not have a shortened lifespan. Some people with the attenuated type have learning disabilities, while others have no intellectual impairments. Heart disease and airway obstruction are major causes of death in people with both types of MPS I.  There is no cure for MPS I. Management requires a multidisciplinary team given the wide range of symptoms. This team may include metabolism (biochemical genetics); primary care; cardiology; pulmonology; gastroenterology; neurology; ear, nose, and throat specialists; audiology; ophthalmology; orthopedics; physical therapy; dental; and developmental specialists. The two main treatment options for MPS I include hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Both treatments work by replacing the missing alpha-L-iduronidase.  HSCT is considered standard of care for individuals with severe MPS I; however, its success is dependent on timing of treatment. It is typically recommended that HSCT occur early in the disease process, prior to two years of age. HSCT can improve facial, auditory, and cardiac manifestations. The effect on intellectual development is unclear with some studies suggesting an improvement, while others report a slowing of cognitive decline. Laronidase  is the enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I. Treatment with laronidase can improve problems with breathing, growth, the bones, joints and heart. However, laronidase does not cross the blood brain barrier and thus, has no effect on intellectual development.   Severe MPS I occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns. Attenuated MPS I is less common and occurs in about 1 in 500,000 newborns.

MPS I is caused by variants in the IDUA gene, located on chromosome 4p16.3. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The IDUA gene provides instructions for producing alpha-L-iduronidase. This lysosomal enzyme is essential for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) which are large sugar molecules. Alpha-L-iduronidase hydrolyzes unsulfated alpha-L-iduronic acid, which is present in two GAGs - heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Deficiency of this enzyme results in accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate within lysosomes. Alpha-L-iduronidase activity is <1% for all forms of MPS1, thus activity level cannot differentiate between severe and attenuated forms. In general, MPS I-H and MPS I-S are considered to be more severe forms of the disease. Children with MPS I often have no obvious signs or symptoms of the condition at birth, although some have an umbilical or inguinal hernia. Those with severe MPS I generally begin to show other signs and symptoms of the disorder within the first year of life, while those with the attenuated form have milder features that develop later in childhood. In the past, MPS-HS was described as having onset of symptoms between 3-5 years of age and MPS-S with onset of symptoms after 5 years of age.  Individuals with MPS I may have macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, heart valve abnormalities, distinctive-looking facial features that are described as \"coarse,\" hepatosplenomegaly, and macroglossia. Vocal cords can also enlarge, resulting in a deep, hoarse voice. The airway may become narrow in many individuals with MPS I, causing frequent upper respiratory infections and obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is also common. Other common features include corneal clouding (which can affect vision), recurrent ear infections and hearing loss (both conductive and sensorineural).  Short stature and contractures are common. The latter may affect mobility. Most people with the severe form of the disorder also have dysostosis multiplex. Contractures of the fingers are common. Carpal tunnel syndrome develops in many children with this disorder and is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. Cervical spine stenosis can compress and damage the spinal cord. A gibbus deformity of the lumbar spine often develops.  While both forms of MPS I can affect many different organs and tissues, individuals with severe MPS I experience a decline in intellectual function and a more rapid disease progression. Developmental delay is usually present by age 1, and severely affected individuals eventually developmentally regress. Children with this form of the disorder usually have a shortened lifespan, sometimes living only into late childhood. Individuals with attenuated MPS I typically live into adulthood and may or may not have a shortened lifespan. Some people with the attenuated type have learning disabilities, while others have no intellectual impairments. Heart disease and airway obstruction are major causes of death in people with both types of MPS I.  There is no cure for MPS I. Management requires a multidisciplinary team given the wide range of symptoms. This team may include metabolism (biochemical genetics); primary care; cardiology; pulmonology; gastroenterology; neurology; ear, nose, and throat specialists; audiology; ophthalmology; orthopedics; physical therapy; dental; and developmental specialists. The two main treatment options for MPS I include hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Both treatments work by replacing the missing alpha-L-iduronidase.  HSCT is considered standard of care for individuals with severe MPS I; however, its success is dependent on timing of treatment. It is typically recommended that HSCT occur early in the disease process, prior to two years of age. HSCT can improve facial, auditory, and cardiac manifestations. The effect on intellectual development is unclear with some studies suggesting an improvement, while others report a slowing of cognitive decline. Laronidase  is the enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I. Treatment with laronidase can improve problems with breathing, growth, the bones, joints and heart. However, laronidase does not cross the blood brain barrier and thus, has no effect on intellectual development.   Severe MPS I occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns. Attenuated MPS I is less common and occurs in about 1 in 500,000 newborns.

The CFI gene is located on chromosome 4q25. Variants in this gene also cause autosomal recessive Complement Factor I deficiency. The CFI gene provides instructions for making complement factor I, a protein that is important in regulating and preventing activation of the complement cascade when not needed. It is a serine protease that cleaves and inactivates C4b and C3b. Factor I is a plasma glycoprotein composed of 2 polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds: both light and heavy chains of factor I are encoded by the CFI gene. The light chain contains the serine protease domain. This is a rare disorder with no specific age of onset. Of reported patients, age of onset has ranged from 17 months of age to 32 years of age.   Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function and can occur at any age. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal thrombus formation in small blood vessels in the kidneys. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. Hemolytic anemia results in pallor, jaundice, fatigue, dyspnea and tachycardia. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, individuals with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases .Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome which is caused by infection with strains of E. coli that produce Shiga-like toxin. The typical form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger than 10. The typical form is less likely than the atypical form to involve recurrent attacks of kidney damage that lead to ESRD.  Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by variants in the CFI gene is rare. The incidence of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 500,000 people per year in the United States, of which 4-8% of cases are related to variants in CFI.  ", "Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure.Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate.Thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cells that normally assist with blood clotting. In people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream because a large number of platelets are used to make abnormal clots. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases. These life-threatening complications prevent the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The two disorders have different causes and different signs and symptoms. Unlike the atypical form, the typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce toxic substances called Shiga-like toxins.

", "X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is a disorder of the immune system and blood-forming cells that is found almost exclusively in males. More than half of individuals with this disorder experience an exaggerated immune response to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a very common virus that eventually infects most humans. In some people it causes infectious mononucleosis (commonly known as mono). Normally, after initial infection, EBV remains in certain immune system cells (lymphocytes) called B cells. However, the virus is generally inactive (latent) because it is controlled by other lymphocytes called T cells that specifically target EBV-infected B cells.People with XLP may respond to EBV infection by producing abnormally large numbers of T cells, B cells, and other lymphocytes called macrophages. This proliferation of immune cells often causes a life-threatening reaction called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis causes fever, destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, and damages the liver. The spleen, heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues may also be affected. In some individuals with XLP, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or related symptoms may occur without EBV infection.About one-third of people with XLP experience dysgammaglobulinemia, which means they have abnormal levels of some types of antibodies. Antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) are proteins that attach to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. Individuals with dysgammaglobulinemia are prone to recurrent infections.Cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas) occur in about one-third of people with XLP.Without treatment, most people with XLP survive only into childhood. Death usually results from hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.XLP can be divided into two types based on its genetic cause and pattern of signs and symptoms: XLP1 (also known as classic XLP) and XLP2. People with XLP2 have not been known to develop lymphoma, are more likely to develop hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis without EBV infection, usually have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), and may also have inflammation of the large intestine (colitis). Some researchers believe that these individuals should actually be considered to have a similar but separate disorder rather than a type of XLP."], "alternate_names": ["LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME,

characterized by very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. It is caused by variants in the IL10RA gene located on chromosome 11q23.3. This gene encodes a protein known as Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit. It is  structurally related to interferon receptors and acts as a receptor for interleukin 10. Interleukin 10 functions as an immunosuppressive signal that inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.   Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in this gene result in very early onset inflammatory bowel disease with onset usually in the first year of life. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea,  severe enterocolitis/pancolitis with enteric fistulas, perianal abscesses, chronic folliculitis, oral ulcerations and fever, similar to findings seen in Crohn disease. Recurrent respiratory, genitourinary and cutaneous infections are often present. Affected individuals are at high risk of developing B-cell lymphoma. While granulomas may be present, intestinal biopsies often demonstrate only nonspecific inflammation.   Pharmacologic treatment of VEO-IBD caused by variants in IL10RA (systemic corticosteroids, biologics, antibiotics) is generally ineffective and usually only results in temporary improvements in symptoms. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered first line therapy and should be done promptly.  Exact prevalence of this condition is not known but is reported as  <1 / 1,000,000.

It is caused by variants in the IL10RB gene located on chromosome 21q22.11. This gene encodes the interleukin-10 receptor beta subunit (also known as IL10R2 protein),  a cell surface receptor accessory chain that is essential for the active interleukin 10 receptor complex and that is required for the activation of 5 class 2 cytokines (IL10, IL22, IL26, IL28 and IFNL1). Co-expression of IL10RB and IL10RA proteins is required for IL10-induced signal transduction. Interleukin 10 functions as an immunosuppressive signal that inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.   Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in this gene result in very early onset inflammatory bowel disease with onset usually in the first year of life. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea,  severe enterocolitis/pancolitis with enteric fistulas, perianal abscesses, chronic folliculitis, oral ulcerations and fever. Recurrent respiratory and cutaneous infections are often present. Affected individuals are at high risk of developing B-cell lymphoma.  Pharmacologic treatment of VEO-IBD caused by variants in IL10RB (systemic corticosteroids, biologics, antibiotics) is generally ineffective and usually only results in temporary improvements in symptoms. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered first line therapy and should be done promptly.  Exact prevalence of this condition is not known but is reported as  <1 / 1,000,000.

Many cases of PNDM4 have been observed to be caused by de novo mutations.  The INS gene provides instructions for producing the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced as a precursor form called proinsulin, that is cleaved to form A and B chains, which are joined together by disulfide bonds to form insulin. Variants in this gene are reported to cause about 1% of cases of MODY. It is not clear how these variants cause diabetes although there is some evidence that insulin biosynthesis is affected. At least 10 mutations in the INS gene have been identified in people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.

Several different genes have been found to be responsible for the Brugada syndrome phenotype. One of these is ABCC9. Autosomal dominant variants in ABCC9 can cause several different phenotypes, including Brugada syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrichotic osteochondrohdysplasia. ABCC9, located on chromosome 12p12.1,  provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) protein. This protein forms one subunit of an ATP-sensitive potassium channel.  Each channel consists of eight subunits: four SUR2 proteins and four proteins encoded by either KCNJ8 or KCNJ11. These channels open and close in response to the amount of intracellular ATP. The resulting transport of potassium ions is part of a complex network of signals that relay chemical messages into and out of cells. Although K-ATP channels are present in cells and tissues throughout the body, the highest levels of SUR2-containing channels are found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. These channels indirectly help regulate the concentration of calcium ions in cells. This regulation is essential for normal heart function. The function of these channels in other tissues is unclear. The main symptom of Brugada syndrome is irregular heartbeats that, without treatment, may potentially result in sudden death.  Recent reports suggest that Brugada syndrome could be responsible for up to 20% of sudden death in patients with structurally normal hearts. Brugada syndrome may affect individuals of any age, but symptoms most often occur in middle-aged men around the age of 40. Frequently, sudden death can be the first manifestation of the disease. Recommendations for treatment of asymptomatic individuals are controversial.  Treatment may be pharmacologic with either isoprenaline or quinidine for unstable ventricular arrhythmias.  Individuals at a high risk of ventricular fibrillation are treated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators or epicardial substrate ablation. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease and follows autosomal dominant inheritance. It is most commonly caused by variants in SCN5A. Currently, the prevalence of Brugada syndrome is estimated at 5 in 10,000 people. The prevalence of Brugada syndrome caused by ABCC9 variants is unknown.", "Brugada syndrome is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm. Specifically, this disorder can lead to irregular heartbeats in the heart's lower chambers (ventricles), which is an abnormality called ventricular arrhythmia. If untreated, the irregular heartbeats can cause fainting (syncope), seizures, difficulty breathing, or sudden death. These complications typically occur when an affected person is resting or asleep.Brugada syndrome usually becomes apparent in adulthood, although it can develop any time throughout life. Signs and symptoms related to arrhythmias, including sudden death, can occur from early infancy to late adulthood. Sudden death typically occurs around age 40. This condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of death in babies younger than 1 year.

The ABCC9 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) protein. This protein forms one subunit of an ATP-sensitive potassium channel that transports potassium ions across cell membranes. Each of these channels consists of eight subunits: four SUR2 proteins and four proteins produced from either the KCNJ8 or KCNJ11 gene. The SUR2 subunits regulate the activity of the channel, determining whether it is open or closed. The channels open and close in response to the amount of ATP, the cell's main energy source, inside the cell. The resulting transport of potassium ions is part of a complex network of signals that relay chemical messages into and out of cells. Although K-ATP channels are present in cells and tissues throughout the body, the highest levels of SUR2-containing channels are found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. These channels indirectly help regulate the concentration of calcium ions in cells. This regulation is essential for normal heart function. The function of these channels in other tissues is unclear. It is unknown how this problem with potassium channel function leads to excess hair growth, heart defects, and the other features of Cant\u00fa syndrome.  Cant\u00fa syndrome is a rare condition characterized by hypertrichosis, a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, and several other abnormalities. Age of onset of symptoms is in the neonatal period. The features of the disorder vary among affected individuals. People with Cant\u00fa syndrome have thick scalp hair that extends onto the forehead and grows down onto the cheeks in front of the ears. They also have increased body hair, especially on the back, arms, and legs. Most affected individuals have macrocephaly and distinctive facial features that are described as \"coarse.\" These include a broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, and a wide mouth with full lips. As affected individuals get older, the face lengthens, the chin becomes more prominent, and the eyes become deep-set.  Many infants with Cant\u00fa syndrome are born with a heart defect such as cardiomegaly or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Other heart problems have also been found in people with Cant\u00fa syndrome, including pericardial effusion and pulmonary hypertension. Additional features of this condition include distinctive skeletal abnormalities, a large body size (macrosomia) at birth, a reduced amount of subcutaneous fat beginning in childhood, deep horizontal creases in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. Other signs and symptoms that have been reported include lymphedema, scoliosis, and osteopenia. Some affected children have hypotonia that delays the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. Most have mildly delayed speech, and some affected children have mild intellectual disability or learning problems.  Management of Cant\u00fa syndrome is largely symptomatic. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Surgical or device closure of PDA in infancy or early childhood may be needed. Pericardiocentesis and pericardial stripping may be needed to treat pericardial effusion. Compression stockings may be used for management of peripheral edema.  In teenagers and adults, hypertrichosis can be managed by shaving or laser hair removal. Scoliosis may require bracing and/or surgery. Management of migraine headaches and developmental delays are tailored to the individual.    Annual surveillance of cardiac size and function, as well as for evidence of pericardial effusion is recommended, along with clinical evaluation and monitoring of cardiac biomarkers to assess for late development of high-output cardiac failure. In adolescence, patients should be monitored annually for the development of peripheral edema and scoliosis. If persistent headaches or other neurologic symptoms develop, brain imaging for cerebral vasculature abnormalities and evaluation by a neurologist are recommended.  Cant\u00fa syndrome is a rare condition. Prevalence is reported as <1 / 1 000 000.  About three dozen affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature.

The FOXP3 gene encodes the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) protein that functions as a transcription factor that controls the development and function of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells. These cells are a major lymphocyte population involved in development of self-tolerance and downregulation of immune responses.   IPEX syndrome most commonly develops during the first few days or weeks of life and affects exclusively boys. It classically manifests with the sequential appearance of the triad of enteropathy, autoimmune disease (particularly Type I diabetes mellitus), and cutaneous involvement, but the clinical features and severity of the disease can vary considerably among individuals. Severe autoimmune enteropathy manifests with intractable secretory diarrhea leading to malabsorption, electrolyte disturbances and failure to thrive. Vomiting, ileus, gastritis or colitis can also be observed. Autoimmune endocrinopathies, generally insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or thyroiditis leading to hypo- or hyperthyroidism, are common, often manifesting in infancy or early childhood. Skin involvement consists of a generalized intensely pruritic eruption resembling eczema, psoriasis, and/or atopic or exfoliative dermatitis. Less frequently, alopecia or onychodystrophy can be observed. Affected males may develop autoimmune cytopenias, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia and neutropenia. Autoimmune involvement may also lead to pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, myositis, splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy. Local or systemic infections such as pneumonia, staphylococcal infections or candidiasis may also occur but are due to loss of skin and gut barriers, immunosuppressive therapies, and poor nutrition rather than a primary immunodeficiency. Neurological findings including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy and hypotonia have been described.  The only curative treatment for IPEX is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is much more successful when performed in the early stages of the disease. Supportive measures include monotherapy or combined immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids (usually prednisone or methylprednisolone) and T cell-directed immune suppression (cyclosporin A , tacrolimus, sirolimus or rapamycin). This may need to be continued after HSCT.   Lifelong insulin and thyroid hormone supplementation is needed in cases of organ failure. Topical cyclosporin A is often used for skin manifestations, which should be treated aggressively to prevent infection. Rituximab is effective in treating pemphigus nodularis and other autoantibody-mediated disease. G-CSF has been used to treat autoimmune neutropenia. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy can be considered for those with autoimmune neutropenia or recurrent infections.  Parenteral nutrition or other nutritional support is often needed, particularly in severe cases of enteropathy.  Without timely diagnosis and treatment, the disease is usually fatal within the first 2 years of life in severe cases. With appropriate immunosuppressive treatment, affected males are surviving into childhood. With HSCT, life expectancy is likely to be normal, and disease progression halted, although feeding difficulties may persist for many months post HSCT. Neurodevelopment is usually normal.  IPEX syndrome is a rare disorder that affects an estimated 1 in 1.6 million people, although the exact prevalence is unknown. The disease has probably been underestimated, and milder clinical phenotypes surviving to adult life are being described.

The ITGB2 gene provides instructions for making the \u03b22 subunit of at least four different proteins known as \u03b22 integrins. The other subunit can be one of a variety of alpha (\u03b1) subunits that are produced from different genes. Integrins are a group of proteins that regulate cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix adhesion. Integrins also transmit signals that regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes.  Integrins that contain the \u03b22 subunit are found embedded in the cell membrane of leukocytes. \u03b22 integrins are important in leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection or injury, where they are needed to contribute to the immune response. \u03b22 integrins recognize signs of inflammation and bind to ligands on the lining of blood vessels. This binding leads to adhesion of the leukocyte to the blood vessel wall. Signaling through the \u03b22 integrins triggers the transport of the attached leukocyte across the blood vessel wall to the site of infection or injury.  Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency such that the immune system is unable to effectively protect the body from viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Starting from birth, people with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 develop serious bacterial and fungal infections.  One of the first signs of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is a delay in the detachment of the umbilical cord stump after birth. In newborns, the stump normally falls off within the first two weeks of life; but, in infants with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, this separation usually occurs at three weeks or later. In addition, affected infants often develop omphalitis due to a bacterial infection.  In leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, bacterial and fungal infections most commonly occur on the skin and mucous membranes such as the moist lining of the nose and mouth. In childhood, people with this condition develop severe gingivitis and periodontitis, often resulting in the loss of both primary and permanent teeth. These infections often spread to cover a large area. A hallmark of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is the lack of pus formation at the sites of infection. In people with this condition, wounds are slow to heal, which can lead to additional infection.  Life expectancy in individuals with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is often severely shortened. Due to repeat infections, affected individuals may not survive past infancy.  The main aspect of treatment is antibiotic therapy to treat the repeated, characteristic infections associated with the condition. Prompt antibiotic therapy is essential during acute infectious episodes. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy, often given continuously (usually trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) is required. Granulocyte transfusions have also been used. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only effective treatment to date and can be curative. Lentiviral-Mediated Ex-Vivo Gene Therapy is actively under investigation for the treatment of this condition. Phase I/2 open-label clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with a lentiviral vector (LV) carrying the ITGB2 gene have been completed,  carrying the promise of gene-therapy for this condition in the near future.

The JAK3 gene  product encodes an intracellular tyrosine kinase (leukocyte Janus kinase) that participates in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This pathway is important for chemical signaling from the extracellular milieu to the cell nucleus and is critical for the normal development and function of the immune system. Specifically, JAK3 regulates the maturation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as playing a role in the maturation of B cells, thus performing a crucial role in regulation of the entire immune system. T cells, B cells and NK cells are important in protecting against bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Without functional JAK3 protein, lymphocyte growth and development are impaired and affected individuals have few or no T cells and NK cells with a normal number of poorly functioning B cells. The shortage of functional lymphocytes causes affected individuals to be susceptible to infections.  JAK3-deficient SCID usually presents in infancy. Since affected individuals lack the necessary immune cells to fight off certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi, they are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with JAK3-deficient SCID are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people. Affected infants typically develop chronic diarrhea, oral thrush, pneumonia, and skin rashes. Materno-fetal transfusion-associated graft versus host disease is also associated with the condition. Persistent illness also causes affected individuals to grow more slowly than other children. Without treatment, people with JAK3-deficient SCID usually live only into early childhood.  The treatment of choice for SCID due to JAK3 deficiency is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using HLA-identical siblings, matched unrelated volunteer donors, or haploidentical parents as donors. The lack of NK cells (and NK cell function) in JAK3-deficient patients makes graft rejection improbable, thereby facilitating the success of HSCT. In addition, the early block in thymic T cell development characteristic of JAK3 deficiency probably favors thymic repopulation by donor's normal lymphoid precursors and their differentiation into mature T cells. Gene therapy is under investigation. Avoidance of infection, antimicrobial prophylaxis (IVIG, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis) and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii are recommended.  JAK3-deficient SCID accounts for an estimated 7 to 14 percent of cases of SCID. The prevalence of SCID from all genetic causes combined is approximately 1 in 50,000, although it may be higher in certain regions or populations.

This condition is more common in certain populations, affecting up to 1 in 2,500 newborns.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal dominant==Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Familial Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia 2 (HHF2) is a genetic condition that can  be caused by either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in the KCNJ11 gene located on chromosome 11p15. Pathogenic activating variants in this gene can also cause the autosomal dominant conditions Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus 3, Permanent Neonatal Diabetes with or without Neurologic Features 2 and Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young, type 13 . This gene provides instructions for making a subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K-ATP). Each K-ATP channel is composed of four subunits encoded by KCNJ11 and four subunits encoded by the ABCC8 gene. K-ATP channels are found in pancreatic beta cells. These cell membrane embedded channels respond to the concentration of glucose in the blood,  closing when glucose levels are increased. This closure results in the release of insulin. Mutations in the KCNJ11/ABCC8 genes are known to cause defects in the biogenesis and trafficking of these subunits to the plasma membrane, thus causing hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Loss of K-ATP channel function results in a constant release of insulin from beta cells, resulting in rapid removal of glucose from the bloodstream and hypoglycemia.   Congenital hyperinsulinism  is the most frequent cause of severe, persistent hypoglycemia in newborn babies, infants, and children. It occurs in approximately 1/25,000 to 1/50,000 births. About 60% of babies with hyperinsulinism are diagnosed during the first month of life. An additional 30% are diagnosed later in the first year and the remainder after that. With early treatment and aggressive prevention of hypoglycemia, brain damage can be prevented. However, brain damage can occur in children with congenital hyperinsulinism if the condition is not recognized or if treatment is ineffective in the prevention of hypoglycemia.   Pathogenic variants in KCNJ11 can cause either diffuse or focal disease. K-ATP hyperinsulinism was previously known as nesidioblastosis. Neonates with this form of hyperinsulinism frequently have birth weights greater than normal, often greater than 9 pounds. Inheritance of this condition is somewhat complicated. Diffuse K-ATP hyperinsulinism is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, although recently autosomal dominant pathogenic variants have been described that cause diffuse disease. In the case of recessive inheritance, a pathogenic variant in KCNJ11 is inherited from each parent and each pancreatic beta cell is abnormal. Focal congenital hyperinsulinism, on the other hand, presents when a recessive pathogenic variant is inherited from the father (paternal inheritance) and there is loss of heterozygosity of the maternal copy of the gene from a few pancreatic cells. In this case, abnormal beta cells are limited to the focal lesion which is surrounded by normal beta cells. Approximately 80% of congenital hyperinsulinism cases that are refractory to diazoxide treatment are caused by pathogenic variants in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11. K-ATP mutations are involved in 15% of diazoxide-responsive congenital hyperinsulinism cases that are either sporadic or dominantly inherited.  Children with either form of K-ATP-hyperinsulinism are identical in their appearance and behavior. They tend to have significant hypoglycemia within the first few days of life and require large amounts of glucose to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations. They may have seizures due to hypoglycemia. Diazoxide is often an ineffective treatment for these children since diazoxide works on the K-ATP channel and it cannot fix the broken channels. Octreotide given by injection every 6 to 8 hours or by continuous infusion may be successful but tends to be used short-term. Glucagon may be given by intravenous infusion to stabilize the blood sugar as a temporary measure in the hospital setting. Some centers prefer the surgical approach. With the discovery of diffuse and focal K-ATP-hyperinsulinism, attempts to differentiate these two forms are very important: surgical resection will cure focal disease but will not cure diffuse disease although it can help to prevent severe hypoglycemia and brain damage.   Congenital Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia is a rare disorder occurring in about 1:40,000 births. Loss of function variants in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 are the most common cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia accounting for 40-50% of cases.  ", "Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. People with this condition have frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating."], "alternate_names": ["DIABETES MELLITUS, PERMANENT NEONATAL 2; PNDM2", "HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 2; HHF2", "DIABETES MELLITUS, TRANSIENT NEONATAL, 3"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 6257.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "KCNJ11"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Octreotide", "timeframe_int1": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int1": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int1": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug1": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug1": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_2": "Sirolimus", "timeframe_int2": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int2": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int2": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug2": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug2": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_3": "Diazoxide", "timeframe_int3": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int3": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int3": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug3": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug3": "Effective / Ameliorative"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Sirolimus therapy for congenital hyperinsulinism in an infant with a novel homozygous KCNJ11 mutation.", "pmid_1": 29176012.0, "pmid_date_1": 2018.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM"}, {"pmid_title_2": "A Novel Homozygous Mutation in the KCNJ11 Gene of a Neonate with Congenital Hyperinsulinism and Successful Management with Sirolimus.", "pmid_2": 27181099.0, "pmid_date_2": 2016.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Journal of clinical research in pediatric endocrinology"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to homozygous KCNJ11 (T294M) mutation.", "pmid_3": 20589481.0, "pmid_date_3": 2010.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Indian journal of pediatrics"}]}, {"_id": "6257-OMIM:610582", "condition": {"condition_name": "DIABETES MELLITUS, TRANSIENT NEONATAL, 3", "freq_per_birth": "In the United States, up to 14 percent of all pregnancies are affected by gestational diabetes.

Currently, 20 known genes have been found to be responsible for the Brugada syndrome phenotype. One of these is KCNJ8. Autosomal dominant variants in KCNJ8 can cause several different phenotypes, including Brugada syndrome and Hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia, Cantu type. Defects in this gene have been associated with sudden infant death syndrome. The KCNJ8 gene is located on chromosome 12p12.1 and encodes the alpha subunit of the ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 8. The channel is composed of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit which is encoded by the ABCC9 gene.  Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by KCNJ8 is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. This channel, which is controlled by G-proteins, has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell. The precise mechanism of how gain of function mutations in this gene cause Brugada syndrome remains unknown.  The main symptom of Brugada syndrome is irregular heartbeats that, without treatment, may potentially result in sudden death.  Recent reports suggest that Brugada syndrome could be responsible for up to 20% of sudden death in patients with structurally normal hearts. Brugada syndrome may affect individuals of any age, but symptoms most often occur in middle-aged men around the age of 40. Frequently, sudden death can be the first manifestation of the disease. Recommendations for treatment of asymptomatic individuals are controversial. Risk stratification analysis has been developed to determine the appropriate approach to therapy and algorithms have been published (PMID: 28431071). Treatment of asymptomatic patients is supportive. Treatment of symptomatic patients may be pharmacologic with either isoprenaline or quinidine for unstable ventricular arrhythmias.  Individuals at a high risk of ventricular fibrillation are treated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Epicardial substrate ablation is often used in Brugada syndrome patients experiencing frequent appropriate ICD-shocks. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease and follows autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Brugada syndrome is most commonly caused by variants in SCN5A, the cardiac predominant pore-forming channel alpha subunit, which affects sodium channel Nav1.5 function and accounts for 20-30% of patients. Mutations in other genes account for 5% of patients. The prevalence of Brugada syndrome is estimated at 5 in 10,000 people. The prevalence of Brugada syndrome caused by KCNJ8 variants is unknown.  ", "Brugada syndrome is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm. Specifically, this disorder can lead to irregular heartbeats in the heart's lower chambers (ventricles), which is an abnormality called ventricular arrhythmia. If untreated, the irregular heartbeats can cause fainting (syncope), seizures, difficulty breathing, or sudden death. These complications typically occur when an affected person is resting or asleep.Brugada syndrome usually becomes apparent in adulthood, although it can develop any time throughout life. Signs and symptoms related to arrhythmias, including sudden death, can occur from early infancy to late adulthood. Sudden death typically occurs around age 40. This condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of death in babies younger than 1 year.

Autosomal dominant variants in KCNJ8 can cause several different phenotypes, including Brugada syndrome and Hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia, Cant\u00fa type. Defects in this gene have been associated with sudden infant death syndrome. The KCNJ8 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 8. The channel is composed of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit which is encoded by the ABCC9 gene.  Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by KCNJ8 is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. This channel, which is controlled by G-proteins, has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell. It is unknown how this problem with potassium channel function leads to excess hair growth, heart defects, and the other features of Cant\u00fa syndrome.  Cant\u00fa syndrome is a rare condition characterized by hypertrichosis, a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, and several other abnormalities. Age of onset of symptoms is in the neonatal period. The features of the disorder vary among affected individuals. People with Cant\u00fa syndrome have thick scalp hair that extends onto the forehead and grows down onto the cheeks in front of the ears. They also have increased body hair, especially on the back, arms, and legs. Most affected individuals have macrocephaly and distinctive facial features that are described as \"coarse.\" These include a broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, and a wide mouth with full lips. As affected individuals get older, the face lengthens, the chin becomes more prominent, and the eyes become deep-set.  Many infants with Cant\u00fa syndrome are born with a heart defect such as cardiomegaly or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Other heart problems have also been found in people with Cant\u00fa syndrome, including pericardial effusion and pulmonary hypertension. Additional features of this condition include distinctive skeletal abnormalities, a large body size (macrosomia) at birth, a reduced amount of subcutaneous fat beginning in childhood, deep horizontal creases in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. Other signs and symptoms that have been reported include lymphedema, scoliosis, and osteopenia. Some affected children have hypotonia that delays the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. Most have mildly delayed speech, and some affected children have mild intellectual disability or learning problems.  Management of Cant\u00fa syndrome is largely symptomatic. Surgical or device closure of PDA in infancy or early childhood may be needed. Pericardiocentesis and pericardial stripping may be needed to treat or prevent recurrent and hemodynamically significant pericardial effusions. Compression stockings may be used for management of peripheral edema.  In teenagers and adults, hypertrichosis can be managed by shaving or laser hair removal. Scoliosis may require bracing and/or surgery. Management of migraine headaches and developmental delays are tailored to the individual.    Annual surveillance of cardiac size and function, as well as for evidence of pericardial effusion is recommended, along with clinical evaluation and monitoring of cardiac biomarkers to assess for late development of high-output cardiac failure. In adolescence, patients should be monitored annually for the development of peripheral edema and scoliosis. If persistent headaches or other neurologic symptoms develop, brain imaging for cerebral vasculature abnormalities and evaluation by a neurologist are recommended.

The KCNQ1 gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels. These channels transport potassium out of cells which is necessary for cells to generate and transmit electrical signals. KCNQ1-containing channels are found primarily in the inner ear and in cardiac muscle. Functional potassium channels are made of four alpha subunits (KCNQ1) and one beta subunit (from the KCNE family) that binds to the channel and regulates its activity.  In the ear, these channels are needed for normal hearing, while in the heart, they are needed for repolarization and maintenance of a regular rhythm. KCNQ1 is also found in the kidney, lung, stomach and intestine.  In people with Long QT syndrome, also known as Romano-Ward syndrome, the QT interval is abnormally long and the heart muscle takes longer than usual to repolarize between beats resulting in abnormal heart rhythms. Variants in KCNQ1 reduce the channels' ability to transport potassium ions out of cardiac muscle cells affecting the cell's ability to transmit electrical signals, thus increasing the risk of an irregular heartbeat that can cause syncope or sudden death. Hearing is not affected.  Although cardiac events may present anytime from infancy through middle age, they are most commonly seen in the preteen years through the 20s. The risk of cardiac events decreases over time. Some individuals exhibit reduced penetrance and despite having a pathogenic variant in KCNQ1 never develop signs and symptoms of the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance.  The primary treatment for long QT syndrome is pharmacologic with beta-blockers in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals who meet diagnostic criteria. Sodium channel blockers can be a useful adjunct therapy in some.  Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and/or left cardiac sympathetic denervation may be indicated for those with beta-blocker resistant symptoms, for those who cannot take beta blockers or for those with a history of cardiac arrest.    Romano-Ward syndrome is the most common form of inherited long QT syndrome, which affects an estimated 1 in 2,000 people worldwide. Mutations in the KCNQ1 gene are thought to be the most common cause of Romano-Ward syndrome accounting for approximately one-third of cases.  ", "Romano-Ward syndrome is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). This disorder is a form of long QT syndrome, which is a heart condition that causes the heart (cardiac) muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. The term long QT refers to a specific pattern of heart activity that is detected with an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which is a test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. In people with long QT syndrome, the part of the heartbeat known as the QT interval is abnormally long. Abnormalities in the time it takes to recharge the heart lead to abnormal heart rhythms.The arrhythmia associated with Romano-Ward syndrome can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest and sudden death. However, some people with Romano-Ward syndrome never experience any health problems associated with the condition.Fifteen types of long QT syndrome have been defined based on their genetic cause.

The KCNQ1 gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels. These channels transport potassium out of cells which is necessary for cells to generate and transmit electrical signals. KCNQ1-containing channels are found primarily in the inner ear and in cardiac muscle. Functional potassium channels are made of four alpha subunits (KCNQ1) and one beta subunit (from the KCNE family) that binds to the channel and regulates its activity.  In the ear, these channels are needed for normal hearing, while in the heart, they are needed for repolarization and maintenance of a regular rhythm.

Beginning in early childhood, the irregular heartbeats increase the risk of syncope and sudden death).  An inability of KCNQ1 potassium channels to properly transport potassium ions in the inner ear and cardiac muscle leads to the hearing loss and arrhythmia characteristic of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.  About 90% of cases of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome are caused by mutations in KCNQ1. Most changes lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the KCNQ1 protein that cannot be used to build potassium channels while other mutations alter the normal structure and function of the channels. Both copies of the KCNQ1 gene are altered in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (unlike other KCNQ1-related syndromes that require a change in only one copy of the gene).  Hearing loss is typically treated with cochlear implantation. Beta-blockers, often only partially effective, are used for managing long QT interval. For those who fail to respond to other treatments or have a history of cardiac arrest, implantable cardioverter defibrillators are used. Standard treatment for iron deficiency anemia, which is common, is recommended. Special precautions should be taken during anesthesia because of the increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Agents known to prolong the QT interval should be avoided.  Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is uncommon; it affects an estimated 1.6 to 6 per 1 million people worldwide.

The term \"short QT\" refers to a specific pattern of heart activity that is detected with an electrocardiogram (EKG): the QT interval is abnormally short. At least two mutations in the KCNQ1 gene are known to cause short QT syndrome. These variants alter the function to the KCNQ1 potassium channel, resulting in increased activity (gain of function) and increased flow of potassium ions out of cardiac muscle cells, increasing the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause syncope or sudden death. If untreated, the arrhythmia associated with short QT syndrome can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, from syncope to cardiac arrest and sudden death.

However, some people with short QT syndrome never experience any health problems associated with the condition. Treatment of short QT syndrome, according to a consensus statement by The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society, is implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation for all survivors of sudden cardiac arrest or in patients with documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia with or without syncope.  ICD implantation may be considered for asymptomatic patients with SQTS if family history of sudden cardiac death is present according to the HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert consensus.

Other dominant conditions that are linked to this gene include Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 7 and Myokymia. The KCNQ2 gene, located on chromosome 20q13.33, encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that is expressed in the brain. The channel is composed of four KCNQ2 subunits. This channel transports potassium into and out of cells and plays a key role in the neuron's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. These channels transmit a particular type of electrical signal called the M-current, which prevents the neuron from continuing to send signals to other neurons. The M-current ensures that the neuron is not constantly active, or excitable. The KCNQ2 subunit can also interact with KCNQ3 subunits to form another functional potassium channel that transmits a much stronger M-current.  Benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures in newborn babies. The seizures begin around day 3 of life and usually go away within 1 to 4 months. The seizures may be focal or generalized in nature. Many infants with this condition have generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures). This type of seizure involves both sides of the brain and affects the entire body, causing muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. EEG abnormalities, measured during periods of no seizure activity, can indicate a risk for seizures. However, infants with BFNS usually have normal EEG readings. In some affected individuals, the EEG shows a specific abnormality called the theta pointu alternant pattern. By age 2, most affected individuals who had EEG abnormalities have a normal EEG reading. Typically, seizures are the only symptom of BFNS, and most people with this condition develop normally. However, some affected individuals develop intellectual disability that becomes noticeable in early childhood. A small percentage of people with BFNS also have a condition called myokymia, which is an involuntary rippling movement of the muscles. In addition, about 15 percent of people with BFNS develop epilepsy later in life after the seizures associated with BFNS have resolved. The age that epilepsy begins is variable.

EEG usually shows burst suppression which may change to multifocal epileptiform activity. Usually severe neurologic deficits and profound developmental delay accompany this condition. Seizures in some patients may remit after several years, but the developmental delays usually persist even after seizures have discontinued. Treatment is with a combination of anti-epileptic drugs, and a pediatric neurologist should be consulted without delay for management of these patients.

The LHX3 gene encodes a protein that belongs to a large protein family, members of which carry the LIM domain. The LIM domain is a unique cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain. The LHX3 protein is a transcription factor required for pituitary development and motor neuron specification.  Deficiency of this protein results in combined pituitary hormone deficiency.   Combined pituitary hormone deficiency 3 is a pan-ethnic disorder. Patients with this disorder have deficiencies of multiple hormones produced by the pituitary gland, including growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. If untreated, deficiencies of growth hormone result in very short stature, beginning in infancy or childhood; deficiencies of the other hormones cause hypothyroidism and delayed or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics and infertility. LHX3 mutations are associated with Chiari I malformation, corpus callosum agenesis or hypoplasia and skeletal abnormalities. Extra-pituitary findings can include a short neck with abnormal head and neck rotation (70% of cases), vertebral abnormalities (50% of cases) including a rigid cervical spine, flattened lumbar vertebrae, thoracic kyphosis, and progressive scoliosis, and variable degrees of sensorineural hearing loss (50% of cases). Developmental delay or learning difficulties have been reported in up to 40% of known patients. Life expectancy is not shortened, and there are no known genotype-phenotype correlations. The degree to which these hormones are deficient is variable, with prolactin and ACTH showing the most variability. In many affected individuals, ACTH deficiency may not occur until late adulthood.  The prevalence of combined pituitary hormone deficiency is estimated to be 1 in 8,000 individuals worldwide.  Mutations in at least eight genes have been found to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency. Mutations in the PROP1 gene are the most common known cause of this disorder, accounting for an estimated 12 to 55 percent of cases. Mutations in the other genes have each been identified in a smaller number of affected individuals. The prevalence and incidence of combined pituitary hormone deficiency caused by LHX3 is not known.  ", "Combined pituitary hormone deficiency is a condition that causes a shortage (deficiency) of several hormones produced by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. A lack of these hormones may affect the development of many parts of the body. The first signs of this condition include a failure to grow at the expected rate and short stature that usually becomes apparent in early childhood.People with combined pituitary hormone deficiency may have hypothyroidism, which is underactivity of the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland in the lower neck. Hypothyroidism can cause many symptoms, including weight gain and fatigue. Other features of combined pituitary hormone deficiency include delayed or absent puberty and lack the ability to have biological children (infertility). The condition can also be associated with a deficiency of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol deficiency can impair the body's immune system, causing individuals to be more susceptible to infection.Rarely, people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency have intellectual disability; a short, stiff neck; or underdeveloped optic nerves, which carry visual information from the eyes to the brain."], "alternate_names": ["PITUITARY HORMONE DEFICIENCY, COMBINED, 3; CPHD3"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 6595.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "LHX3"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Levothyroxine"}, {"int_description_2": "Somatotropin"}, {"int_description_3": "Hydrocortisone"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Congenital Hypopituitarism: Various Genes, Various Phenotypes.", "pmid_1": 30759489.0, "pmid_date_1": 2019.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme"}, {"pmid_title_2": "A novel mutation of LHX3 is associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency including ACTH deficiency, sensorineural hearing loss, and short neck-a case report and review of the literature.", "pmid_2": 21249393.0, "pmid_date_2": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_2": "European journal of pediatrics"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Novel mutations in LHX3 are associated with hypopituitarism and sensorineural hearing loss.", "pmid_3": 18407919.0, "pmid_date_3": 2008.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Human molecular genetics"}]}, {"_id": "6617-OMIM:278000", "condition": {"condition_name": "LYSOSOMAL ACID LIPASE DEFICIENCY", "freq_per_birth": "Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is estimated to occur in 1 in 40,000 to 300,000 individuals, varying by population.

In affected individuals, harmful amounts of fats (lipids) accumulate in cells and tissues throughout the body, which typically causes liver disease. There are two forms of the condition. The most severe and rarest form begins in infancy. The less severe form can begin from childhood to late adulthood.In the severe, early-onset form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, lipids accumulate throughout the body, particularly in the liver, within the first weeks of life. This accumulation of lipids leads to several health problems, including an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), poor weight gain, a yellow tint to the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), vomiting, diarrhea, fatty stool (steatorrhea), and poor absorption of nutrients from food (malabsorption). In addition, affected infants often have calcium deposits in small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands), low amounts of iron in the blood (anemia), and developmental delay. Scar tissue quickly builds up in the liver, leading to liver disease (cirrhosis). Infants with this form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency develop multi-organ failure and severe malnutrition and generally do not survive past 1 year.In the later-onset form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, signs and symptoms vary and usually begin in mid-childhood, although they can appear anytime up to late adulthood. Nearly all affected individuals develop an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly); an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) may also occur. About two-thirds of individuals have liver fibrosis, eventually leading to cirrhosis. Approximately one-third of individuals with the later-onset form have malabsorption, diarrhea, vomiting, and steatorrhea. Individuals with this form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency may have increased liver enzymes and high cholesterol levels, which can be detected with blood tests.Some people with this later-onset form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency develop an accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis). Although these deposits are common in the general population, they usually begin at an earlier age in people with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. The deposits narrow the arteries, increasing the chance of heart attack or stroke. The expected lifespan of individuals with later-onset lysosomal acid lipase deficiency depends on the severity of the associated health problems.The two forms of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency were once thought to be separate disorders. The early-onset form was known as Wolman disease, and the later-onset form was known as cholesteryl ester storage disease.

Preemptive transplantation prior to onset of MDS/AML and before multiple transfusions may be appropriate, but its use is a complicated decision. Patients with FA are sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation and require special transplant regimens.  Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and Black South Africans. One case of FA caused by variants in MAD2L2 has been reported in the literature to date.

The signs and symptoms of the combined condition, methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, usually develop in infancy, although they can begin at any age.When the condition begins early in life, affected individuals typically have an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), which is sometimes recognized before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). These infants can also have difficulty feeding and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor). Neurological problems are also common in methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, including weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and seizures. Most infants and children with this condition have an unusually small head size (microcephaly), delayed development, and intellectual disability. Less common features of the condition include eye problems and a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than normal (megaloblastic). The signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria worsen over time, and the condition can be life-threatening if not treated.When methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria begins in adolescence or adulthood, the signs and symptoms usually include psychiatric changes and cognitive problems.

In addition, these individuals can begin to lose previously acquired mental and movement abilities, resulting in a decline in school or work performance, difficulty controlling movements, memory problems, speech difficulties, a decline in intellectual function (dementia), or an extreme lack of energy (lethargy).

It is one form of familial glucocorticoid deficiency.  The MC2R gene provides instructions for making the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. This protein receptor is found primarily in the adrenal glands. The ACTH receptor is embedded in the membrane of cells where it binds to ACTH. ACTH is a hormone that is released by the pituitary gland. The binding of ACTH to its receptor triggers the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoid hormones. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body. The ACTH receptor also likely plays a role in the development of the adrenal glands during fetal development. Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce glucocorticoids. Adrenal insufficiency causes the signs and symptoms of  familial glucocorticoid deficiency. These signs and symptoms often begin in infancy or early childhood. Most affected children first develop hypoglycemia. These hypoglycemic children can fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate. If left untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, learning difficulties, and other neurological problems. Hypoglycemia that is left untreated for prolonged periods can lead to neurological damage and death. Other features of familial glucocorticoid deficiency can include recurrent infections and skin hyperpigmentation.   Treatment is with glucocorticoids. Some patients benefit from the addition of mineralocorticoids if  there is inadequate response to glucocorticoid replacement.  The prevalence of familial glucocorticoid deficiency is unknown. MC2R gene mutations account for approximately 25 percent of cases of familial glucocorticoid deficiency.    ", "Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition that occurs when the adrenal glands, which are hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney, do not produce certain hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body.A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) causes the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. These signs and symptoms often begin in infancy or early childhood. Most affected children first develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).

This gene is also known as the MCP gene. CD46 encodes the membrane cofactor protein (MCP), a widely expressed transmembrane glycoprotein, highly expressed in the kidney. MCP acts as a cofactor for Complement Factor I protein to cleave C3b and C4b deposited on the host cell surface. It is likely that mutations in CD46 confer a predisposition to developing atypical hemolytic syndrome (aHUS), rather than directly causing the disease: conditions triggering complement activation may result in an acute event in individuals with this genetic background. CD46 pathogenic variants lead to severely reduced MCP expression on the cell surface or impaired C3b-binding capability and/or capacity to block complement activation. Notably, penetrance (the proportion of individuals carrying a variant allele of CD46 that also develop atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome) is approximately 53%. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes thrombi to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. Atypical HUS associated with CD46 pathogenic variants usually presents with a milder acute episode in childhood. Complete remission is seen in about 80% of individuals. Recurrences are frequent but do not have a significant effect on long-term outcome with 60%-70% of individuals remaining dialysis free even after several recurrences. A subgroup of individuals may lose renal function either during the first episode or later in life. Patients with CD46 mutations tend to require less intensive treatment than other forms of genetic atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. First line treatment is with eculizumab (a human anti-C5 monoclonal antibody), although this treatment predisposes individuals to development of meningitis and immunization against Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Haemophilus influenza type B is required prior to eculizumab therapy. If immunization is not possible at least two weeks prior to initiation of therapy, prophylactic antibiotics may be needed. Corticosteroids have also been used. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists have been used to control blood pressure and reduce progression of renal disease. Plasma exchange and plasmapheresis are of limited benefit since CD46 is a trans-membrane protein highly expressed in the kidney. In rare cases where renal transplantation has been required, outcomes have been good with no disease recurrence. Transplantation with a normal kidney likely corrects the defect in these patients. In addition, women who carry pathogenic variants in this gene may be predisposed to developing HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels and a low platelet count) during pregnancy.  The incidence of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 500,000 people per year in the United States. The atypical form is probably about 10 times less common than the typical form. About 70 CD46 pathogenic variants have been reported in individuals with aHUS, suggesting a variant frequency of 5%-9% among all individuals with aHUS.  ", "Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney function. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure.Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate.Thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cells that normally assist with blood clotting. In people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream because a large number of platelets are used to make abnormal clots. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases. These life-threatening complications prevent the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The two disorders have different causes and different signs and symptoms. Unlike the atypical form, the typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce toxic substances called Shiga-like toxins. The typical form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger than 10. The typical form is less likely than the atypical form to involve recurrent attacks of kidney damage that lead to ESRD."], "alternate_names": ["HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME, ATYPICAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2", "HELLP syndrome"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 6953.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "CD46"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Prednisone"}, {"int_description_2": "Dexamethasone"}, {"int_description_3": "Labetalol"}, {"int_description_4": "Doxazosin"}, {"int_description_5": "Amlodipine", "timeframe_int5": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int5": "Infant,Child", "contra_int5": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug5": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug5": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_6": "Eculizumab"}, {"int_description_7": "Basiliximab"}, {"int_description_8": "Etanercept"}, {"int_description_9": "Cyclosporine"}, {"int_description_10": "Metronidazole"}, {"int_description_11": "Sirolimus"}, {"int_description_12": "Piperacillin"}, {"int_description_13": "Captopril"}, {"int_description_14": "Tazobactam"}, {"int_description_15": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"int_description_16": "Ceftriaxone"}, {"int_description_17": "Nifedipine"}, {"int_description_18": "Vincristine"}, {"int_description_19": "Fluconazole"}, {"int_description_20": "Tacrolimus"}, {"int_description_21": "Azathioprine"}, {"int_description_22": "Mycophenolate mofetil"}, {"int_description_23": "Lansoprazole"}, {"int_description_24": "Methylprednisolone"}, {"int_description_25": "Corticosteroids", "timeframe_int25": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int25": "Infant,Child", "contra_int25": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug25": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug25": "Still in Trials / Unproven"}, {"int_description_26": "Iron"}, {"int_description_27": "Calcium carbonate"}, {"int_description_28": "Alginic acid", "timeframe_int28": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int28": "Infant,Child", "contra_int28": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug28": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline"}, {"int_description_29": "Meningococcal vaccine"}, {"int_description_30": "Serine protease inhibitor"}, {"int_description_31": "Sodium bicarbonate", "timeframe_int31": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int31": "Infant,Child", "contra_int31": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug31": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug31": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_32": "Hemodialysis", "timeframe_int32": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int32": "Infant,Child", "contra_int32": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug32": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug32": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_33": "Peritoneal dialysis"}, {"int_description_34": "Plasma exchange"}, {"int_description_35": "Transfusion with packed red cells"}, {"int_description_36": "Bilateral nephrectomy"}, {"int_description_37": "Kidney transplantation"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "A complement factor B mutation in a large kindred with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.", "pmid_1": 24906628.0, "pmid_date_1": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_1": "J Clin Immunol"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Eculizumab for the treatment of two recurrences of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in a kidney allograft.", "pmid_2": 22591029.0, "pmid_date_2": 2012.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Transpl Int"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Complement deficiency states and associated infections.", "pmid_3": 21624663.0, "pmid_date_3": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Mol Immunol"}, {"pmid_title_4": "Insufficient protection by Neisseria meningitidis vaccination alone during eculizumab therapy.", "pmid_4": 21643943.0, "pmid_date_4": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_4": "Pediatr Nephrol"}, {"pmid_title_5": "Eculizumab safely reverses neurologic impairment and eliminates need for dialysis in severe atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.", "pmid_5": 22287852.0, "pmid_date_5": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_5": "Clin Pharmacol"}, {"pmid_title_6": "An adult with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome and nephrotic syndrome.", "pmid_6": 16183409.0, "pmid_date_6": 2005.0, "pmid_journal_6": "Am J Kidney Dis"}, {"pmid_title_7": "Familial relapsing haemolytic uraemic syndrome and complement factor H deficiency.", "pmid_7": 10344366.0, "pmid_date_7": 1999.0, "pmid_journal_7": "Nephrol Dial Transplant"}, {"pmid_title_8": "Human complement factor H deficiency associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome.", "pmid_8": 9848786.0, "pmid_date_8": 1998.0, "pmid_journal_8": "J Am Soc Nephrol"}]}, {"_id": "704-OMIM:617718", "condition": {"condition_name": "IMMUNODEFICIENCY 71 WITH INFLAMMATORY DISEASE AND CONGENITAL THROMBOCYTOPENIA", "clinical_summary": ["IMMUNODEFICIENCY 71 WITH INFLAMMATORY DISEASE AND CONGENITAL THROMBOCYTOPENIA)  is an autosomal recessive condition caused by variants in the ARPC1B gene located on chromosome 7q22.1 The ARPC1B gene is involved in the control of actin polymerization in cells.

The MTR gene encodes an enzyme, methionine synthase, that converts homocysteine to methionine. This enzymatic reaction requires the cofactor methylcobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) and another enzyme called methionine synthase reductase, which is produced from the MTRR gene. More than 20 mutations in the MTR gene have been identified in people with homocystinuria. The Pro1173Leu or P1173L variant is one of the most commonly identified pathogenic variants in this gene. Without functional methionine synthase, homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. As a result, plasma homocysteine levels are increased while methionine levels are reduced.  Homocystinuria without methylmalonic aciduria manifests mainly in early childhood with failure to thrive, megaloblastic anemia, developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures and cerebral atrophy with white matter abnormalities. Some patients may have an acute presentation in the first few months of life, with vomiting, poor feeding and lethargy. Patients develop homocystinuria, hyperhomocysteinemia and, sometimes, hypomethioninemia. Presentation in adulthood with ataxia, dementia or psychosis has been observed in cblG.  Treatment is based on daily intramuscular injections of 1 mg hydroxycobalamin (OHCbl), tapering the frequency of injections over time to one dose, one to three times a week. A few patients with cblG have required additional treatment with folates and betaine. With treatment, biochemical parameters rapidly normalize and clinical symptoms of hypotonia, lethargy and impaired responsiveness often improve within 24-48 hours. Hematologic parameters also improve. The improvement in psychomotor status is slow and often incomplete.  The prevalence of Homocystinuria-megaloblastic anemia, cblG complementation type is reported to be <1/1000000 (Worldwide).  ", "Homocystinuria is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to process certain building blocks of proteins (amino acids) properly. There are multiple forms of homocystinuria, which are distinguished by their signs and symptoms and genetic cause. The most common form of homocystinuria is characterized by nearsightedness (myopia), dislocation of the lens at the front of the eye, an increased risk of abnormal blood clotting, and brittle bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis) or other skeletal abnormalities. Some affected individuals also have developmental delay and learning problems.Less common forms of homocystinuria can cause intellectual disability, failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), seizures, problems with movement, and a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than normal (megaloblastic).The signs and symptoms of homocystinuria typically develop within the first year of life, although some mildly affected people may not develop features until later in childhood or adulthood."], "alternate_names": ["HOMOCYSTINURIA-MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA, cblG COMPLEMENTATION TYPE; HMAG"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 7468.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "MTR"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Hydroxocobalamin"}, {"int_description_2": "Cyanocobalamin", "timeframe_int2": "Hours", "age_use_int2": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int2": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug2": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug2": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_3": "Cobamamide"}, {"int_description_4": "Levocarnitine"}, {"int_description_5": "Leucovorin", "timeframe_int5": "Hours", "age_use_int5": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int5": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug5": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug5": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_6": "Glycine betaine", "timeframe_int6": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int6": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int6": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug6": "Cohort study or studies", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug6": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_7": "Folic acid", "timeframe_int7": "Hours", "age_use_int7": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int7": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug7": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug7": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_8": "Methionine", "timeframe_int8": "Hours", "age_use_int8": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int8": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug8": "Authoritative published clinical practice guideline", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug8": "Effective / Ameliorative"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Patients with cobalamin G or J defect missed by the current newborn screening program: diagnosis and novel mutations.", "pmid_1": 30651581.0, "pmid_date_1": 2019.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Journal of human genetics"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Intractable Epilepsy due to MTR Deficiency: Importance of Homocysteine Analysis.", "pmid_2": 28666289.0, "pmid_date_2": 2017.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Neuropediatrics"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Clinical onset and course, response to treatment and outcome in 24 patients with the cblE or cblG remethylation defect complemented by genetic and in vitro enzyme study data.", "pmid_3": 25526710.0, "pmid_date_3": 2015.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Journal of inherited metabolic disease"}]}, {"_id": "746-OMIM:207900", "condition": {"condition_name": "ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA", "freq_per_birth": "Argininosuccinic aciduria occurs in approximately 1 in 70,000 to 218,000 newborns.

Methionine synthase converts homocysteine to methionine. At least 20 mutations in the MTRR gene have been identified in people with homocystinuria. Without methionine synthase reductase, methionine synthase cannot convert homocysteine to methionine. As a result, plasma homocysteine levels are increased, and methionine levels are reduced.  Homocystinuria without methylmalonic aciduria manifests mainly in early childhood with failure to thrive, megaloblastic anemia, developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures and cerebral atrophy with white matter abnormalities. Some patients may have an acute presentation in the first few months of life, with vomiting, poor feeding and lethargy. Patients develop homocystinuria, hyperhomocysteinemia and, sometimes, hypomethioninemia. A mild clinical phenotype and late-onset disease in the absence of neurological involvement have also been described for the cblE disorder.   Treatment is based on daily intramuscular injections of 1 mg hydroxycobalamin (OHCbl), tapering the frequency of injections over time to one dose, one to three times a week. With treatment, biochemical parameters rapidly normalize and clinical symptoms of hypotonia, lethargy and impaired responsiveness may improve within 24-48 hours. Hematologic parameters also improve.

The MVK gene (chromosomal location 12q24.11) provides instructions for making the mevalonate kinase enzyme. This enzyme converts a substance called mevalonic acid into mevalonate-5-phosphate. This conversion is the second step in a pathway that produces cholesterol. Cholesterol is later converted into steroid hormones and bile acids. Steroid hormones are needed for normal development and reproduction, and bile acids are used to digest fats. Mevalonate kinase also helps to produce other substances that are necessary for certain cellular functions, such as cell growth, cell maturation (differentiation), formation of the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton), gene activity (expression), and protein production and modification.  Mevalonate kinase deficiency is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, which typically begin during infancy. Each episode of fever lasts about 3 to 6 days, and the frequency of the episodes varies among affected individuals. In childhood the fevers seem to be more frequent, occurring as often as 25 times a year, but as the individual gets older the episodes occur less often.Mevalonate kinase deficiency has additional signs and symptoms, and the severity depends on the type of the condition. There are two types of mevalonate kinase deficiency: a less severe type called hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) and a more severe type called mevalonic aciduria (MVA).During episodes of fever, people with HIDS typically have enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), abdominal pain, joint pain, diarrhea, skin rashes, and headache. Occasionally they will have painful sores called aphthous ulcers around their mouth. In females, these may also occur around the vagina. Rarely, people with HIDS develop a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the kidneys that can lead to kidney failure. Fever episodes in individuals with HIDS can be triggered by vaccinations, surgery, injury, or stress. Most people with HIDS have abnormally high levels of immune system proteins called immunoglobulin D (IgD) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the blood. It is unclear why some people with HIDS have high levels of IgD and IgA and some do not. Elevated levels of these immunoglobulins do not appear to cause any signs or symptoms. Individuals with HIDS do not have any signs and symptoms of the condition between fever episodes and typically have a normal life expectancy.People with MVA have signs and symptoms of the condition at all times, not just during episodes of fever. Affected children have developmental delay, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), progressive problems with vision, and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Individuals with MVA typically have an unusually small, elongated head.

Affected adults may have short stature and may develop muscle weakness (myopathy) later in life. During fever episodes, people with MVA may have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin rashes. Children with MVA who are severely affected with multiple problems may live only into early childhood; mildly affected individuals may have a normal life expectancy. The mainstay of treatment is symptomatic with nonsteroidal antiflammatory drugs and corticosteroids during acute attacks.

The MYH7 gene provides instructions for making the beta (\u03b2)-myosin heavy chain. This protein is found in cardiac muscle and in type I skeletal muscle fibers. In cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, the \u03b2-myosin heavy chain forms part of a larger protein called type II myosin. Each type II myosin protein consists of two heavy chains (produced from the MYH7 gene) and two pairs of regulatory light chains (produced from several other genes). The heavy chains each have two parts: a head region and a tail region. The head region, called the motor domain, interacts with a protein called actin, which is important for cell movement and shape. The long tail region interacts with other proteins, including the tail regions of other myosin proteins.Type II myosin generates the mechanical force that is needed for muscles to contract. It is integral to sarcomeres, which are the basic units of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are composed of thick filaments made up of type II myosin and thin filaments made up of actin. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract.

Type II citrullinemia is found primarily in the Japanese population, where it occurs in an estimated 1 in 100,000 to 230,000 individuals. Type II also has been reported in other populations, including other people from East Asia, the Middle East, the United States, and the United Kingdom.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Citrullinemia is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood. Two types of citrullinemia have been described; they have different signs and symptoms and are caused by mutations in different genes.   Classic citrullinemia (Type 1 Citrullinemia) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by homozygous or heterozygous pathogenic variants in the ASS1 gene located on chromosome 9q34.11. This gene provides instructions for making the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate synthase I. The urea cycle takes place in liver cells and is critically important for the removal of excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, from the body. Argininosuccinate synthase I catalyzes the third step of the urea cycle resulting in synthesis of argininosuccinic acid from citrulline and aspartic acid. Deficiency of this enzyme results in an accumulation of ammonia and other byproducts of the urea cycle, including citrulline, in the blood. Ammonia is particularly toxic to the nervous system causing neurologic symptoms in the condition.  Type I citrullinemia usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia accumulates, they experience progressive lethargy, poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Some affected individuals develop serious or life-threatening problems. Less commonly, a milder form of type I citrullinemia develops later in childhood or adulthood. This later-onset form is associated with intense headaches, scotomas, ataxia, and lethargy. Rarely, some individuals with mutations in ASS1 remain asymptomatic and never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder.    Management guidelines for Citrullinemia Type I have been developed by the National Organization for Rare Disorders (The NORD Physician Guide) for emergency treatment. The treatment of urea cycle disorders is complex and should be managed by a specialist in inborn errors of metabolism at a center equipped to do so. Dialysis may be required if ammonia levels do not decrease using IV hydration, provision of dextrose and arginine and ammonia scavenger treatment. Long-term treatment requires provision of a special low-protein diet as well as ammonia scavengers and supplements to prevent hyperammonemia. Liver transplantation, often done before one year of age, can also treat citrullinemia. Delays in and failure to maximize treatment have permanent and damaging effects on affected patients.  ", "Citrullinemia is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood. Two types of citrullinemia have been described; they have different signs and symptoms and are caused by mutations in different genes.Type I citrullinemia (also known as classic citrullinemia) usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up, they experience a progressive lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Some affected individuals develop serious liver problems. The health problems associated with type I citrullinemia are life-threatening in many cases. Less commonly, a milder form of type I citrullinemia can develop later in childhood or adulthood. This later-onset form is associated with intense headaches, blind spots (scotomas), problems with balance and muscle coordination (ataxia), and lethargy. Some people with gene mutations that cause type I citrullinemia never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder.Type II citrullinemia chiefly affects the nervous system, causing confusion, restlessness, memory loss, abnormal behaviors (such as aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity), seizures, and coma. Affected individuals often have specific food preferences, preferring protein-rich and fatty foods and avoiding carbohydrate-rich foods. The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically appear during adulthood (adult-onset) and can be triggered by certain medications, infections, surgery, and alcohol intake. These signs and symptoms can be life-threatening in people with adult-onset type II citrullinemia.Adult-onset type II citrullinemia may also develop in people who as infants had a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). This liver condition is also known as neonatal-onset type II citrullinemia. NICCD blocks the flow of bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver) and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of NICCD go away within a year. In rare cases, affected individuals develop other signs and symptoms in early childhood after seeming to recover from NICCD, including delayed growth, extreme tiredness (fatigue), specific food preferences (mentioned above), and abnormal amounts of fats (lipids) in the blood (dyslipidemia). This condition is known as failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Years or even decades later, some people with NICCD or FTTDCD develop the features of adult-onset type II citrullinemia."], "alternate_names": ["CITRULLINEMIA, CLASSIC"]}, "gene information":

However, any of the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) can be affected in this condition. Due to muscle weakness, affected infants may have feeding difficulties. Development of motor skills such as crawling or walking may be delayed. The severity of the myasthenia varies greatly, with some people experiencing minor weakness and others having such severe weakness that they are unable to walk. Some individuals have episodes of breathing problems that may be triggered by fevers or infection.

The NBN gene provides instructions for making a protein called nibrin. This protein is involved in several critical cellular functions, including the repair of damaged DNA. Repairing DNA prevents cells from accumulating genetic damage that may cause them to die or to divide uncontrollably. Because nibrin's function is critical for preventing the formation of cancerous tumors, it is known as a tumor suppressor protein. Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a condition characterized by slow growth, recurrent infections, and an increased risk of developing cancer. The NBN gene mutations that cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome typically lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the nibrin protein. The mutation found in most affected individuals, particularly in Slavic populations of Eastern Europe, deletes five nucleotides from the NBN gene (written as 657_661del5). This mutation leads to the production of a shortened nibrin protein (p70-nibrin) that is less effective than wild-type nibrin in responding to DNA damage, although it does appear to have some residual function. When breaks in DNA are not repaired properly, genetic damage can accumulate. Accumulation of DNA errors results in abnormal cell growth and division, increasing the risk of cancer in individuals with Nijmegen breakage syndrome, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A lack of functional nibrin also results in less immune cell proliferation and immune system dysfunction. It has also been found to cause isolated aplastic anemia or acute lymphoblastic anemia.  Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a condition characterized by short stature, progressive microcephaly, distinctive facial features (sloping forehead, prominent nose, large ears, small jaw, upslanted palpebral fissures), recurrent respiratory tract infections, an increased risk of cancer, intellectual disability, and other health problems. Onset of slow growth is identified in infancy and early childhood. After this period of slow growth, affected individuals grow at a normal rate but remain shorter than their peers. Microcephaly is apparent from birth in the majority of affected individuals. The distinctive facial features  are typically apparent by age 3. Intellectual development is normal in most people with this condition for the first year or two of life, but then development becomes delayed. Skills decline over time, and most affected children and adults have mild to moderate intellectual disability. Individuals with Nijmegen breakage syndrome are also immunodeficient with abnormally low levels of IgG and IgA. They may also have a T cell deficiency. Thus, there is an increased susceptibility to recurrent infections, particularly of the upper respiratory tract and lungs,  such as bronchitis, pneumonia and sinusitis.  Most affected woman have premature ovarian failure and either have primary amenorrhea or have infrequent menstrual periods. Most women with Nijmegen breakage syndrome are unable to have biological children (infertile).  There are no specific therapies available for NBS. Treatment is generally supportive: vitamin E and folic acid supplementation are recommended to improve chromosome stability. If immunodeficiency is identified, then IgG replacement therapy is indicated: IVIg can be used in individuals with severe humoral immunodeficiency and frequent infections. Lymphoid malignancies are treated with standard chemotherapy protocols. Radiation exposure should be avoided due to the increase in exposure to ionizing radiation. Preferred imaging modalities include MRI and/or ultrasound. If radiation therapy is needed, doses should be reduced. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered to treat for immunodeficiency or after first remission from malignancy. Otherwise, further long-term follow up is needed to assess outcomes of HSCT for treatment of Nijmegen breakage syndrome. Hormone replacement therapy should be considered in females of pubertal age after evaluation by an endocrinologist or gynecologist.    ", "Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a condition characterized by short stature, an unusually small head size (microcephaly), distinctive facial features, recurrent respiratory tract infections, an increased risk of cancer, intellectual disability, and other health problems.People with this condition typically grow slowly during infancy and early childhood. After this period of slow growth, affected individuals grow at a normal rate but remain shorter than their peers. Microcephaly is apparent from birth in the majority of affected individuals. The head does not grow at the same rate as the rest of the body, so it appears that the head is getting smaller as the body grows (progressive microcephaly). Individuals with Nijmegen breakage syndrome have distinctive facial features that include a sloping forehead, a prominent nose, large ears, a small jaw, and outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures). These facial features typically become apparent by age 3.People with Nijmegen breakage syndrome have a malfunctioning immune system (immunodeficiency) with abnormally low levels of immune system proteins called immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA). Affected individuals also have a shortage of immune system cells called T cells. The immune system abnormalities increase susceptibility to recurrent infections, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, and other infections affecting the upper respiratory tract and lungs.Individuals with Nijmegen breakage syndrome have an increased risk of developing cancer, most commonly a cancer of immune system cells called non-Hodgkin lymphoma. About half of individuals with Nijmegen breakage syndrome develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma, usually before age 15. Other cancers seen in people with Nijmegen breakage syndrome include brain tumors such as medulloblastoma and glioma, and a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma. People with Nijmegen breakage syndrome are 50 times more likely to develop cancer than people without this condition.Intellectual development is normal in most people with this condition for the first year or two of life, but then development becomes delayed. Skills decline over time, and most affected children and adults have mild to moderate intellectual disability.Most affected woman have premature ovarian failure and do not begin menstruation by age 16 (primary amenorrhea) or have infrequent menstrual periods.

The NCF1 gene provides instructions for making neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (also known as p47-phox). This protein is a subunit of the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in phagocytes, immune cells that play a critical role in destroying invading bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body. The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase. NAPDH oxidase is important for the generation of toxic superoxides from oxygen. Superoxide is used to generate reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.  Chronic granulomatous disease is an immunodeficiency disorder. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People with this condition may also develop areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life. People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Other common areas of infection include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes. Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with chronic granulomatous disease. Most commonly, granulomas occur in the gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract. In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Granulomas within the gastrointestinal tract can progress to abscess formation. Inflammation in the stomach can result in gastric outlet obstruction, leading to an inability to digest food. These digestive problems cause vomiting after eating and weight loss. In the genitourinary tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Lymphadenitis and osteomyelitis can also be complications of the condition, and since both produce immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system. Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders. Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of individuals with chronic granulomatous disease; however, with treatment, most affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood.  Aggressive treatment of infections is warranted. Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis is essential in preventing the infections seen in CGD. Lifelong daily doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibacterial) and itraconazole (anti-fungal) are recommended. Interferon-gamma is also used. Inflammatory bowel disease is often difficult to manage although standard therapies are used. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be curative and is increasingly used. Gene therapy has been successful in a few cases and, while not currently clinically available as standard of care, is expanding. In those with severe infections, granulocyte transfusions are sometimes used, although this treatment is controversial; efficacy is poorly documented and if HSCT is being considered, alloimmunization is a risk.  Chronic granulomatous disease is estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 to 250,000 people worldwide. Mutations in the NCF1 gene account for about 25 percent of cases of chronic granulomatous disease.

Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal infections in their lungs.

Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Additionally, granulomas within the gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses). Inflammation in the stomach can prevent food from passing through to the intestines (gastric outlet obstruction), leading to an inability to digest food. These digestive problems cause vomiting after eating and weight loss. In the genitourinary tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Inflammation of the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) and bone marrow (osteomyelitis), which both produce immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system.Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs.Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce

The NCF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (also known as p67-phox). This protein is a subunit of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Specifically, NADPH oxidase is primarily active in phagocytes. These cells function to catch and destroy bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.  Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections that require aggressive treatment. People with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life. People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal infections in their lungs. Other common areas of infection in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes. Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with chronic granulomatous disease. Most commonly, granulomas occur in the gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract. In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Additionally, granulomas within the gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses). Inflammation in the stomach can prevent food from passing through to the intestines (gastric outlet obstruction), leading to an inability to digest food. These digestive problems cause vomiting after eating and weight loss. In the genitourinary tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Inflammation of the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) and bone marrow (osteomyelitis), which both produce immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system. Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease is a known complication of CGD2 and may require aggressive treatment. Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of individuals with chronic granulomatous disease; however, with treatment, most affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood. Interferon-gamma has been used as prophylaxis but there is debate over its utility. Granulocyte transfusions are controversial, efficacy is poorly documented and if HSCT is being considered, autoimmunization is a risk. This treatment may be considered after treatment with antibiotics/antifungal agents.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used to treat this condition.  Chronic granulomatous disease is estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 to 250,000 people worldwide. More than 50 mutations in the NCF2 gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. Mutations in the NCF2 gene cause less than 5 percent of all cases of this condition.

The NCF4 gene encodes the p40-phox subunit (also known as neutrophil cytosolic factor 4) of NADPH oxidase. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in phagocytes which play a critical role in fighting bacterial and fungal infections.  NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of  neutrophils, immune cells that play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body. As a result of NADPH oxidase deficiency, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders, and neutrophil activity is not regulated. NCF4-related CGD differs from classic CGD:  p40phox-deficient CGD patients suffer mainly from hyperinflammation, most commonly  granulomatous lesions of the gastrointestinal tract and skin, along with peripheral infections. They are generally not susceptible to the invasive bacterial and fungal infections seen in classic CGD-  p40phox-deficient CGD is felt to be clinically milder than classic CGD. In one report, median age of onset of symptoms was 6  years of age (range 1-17 years). Treatment for hyperinflammation, for which there is limited evidence due to the rarity of this condition, has included corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine. Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat granulomatous or other inflammatory complications but should be used with caution, given the underlying microbial killing defect. Biologic agents (i.e., infliximab) have not been shown to be particularly efficacious and may have serious side effects.  Treatment tends to include prolonged treatment with regimens of antimicrobial drugs and IFN-\u03b3. While early implementation of antibacterial prophylaxis is indicated, immediate initiation of antifungal prophylaxis may not be required. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used in refractory cases with good outcomes and resolution of symptoms. Decisions regarding HSCT should be made on a case-by-case basis as NCF4-related CGD has a milder phenotype and greater variability among patients than other forms of CGD. Overall,  its clinical outcome is better than of classic CGD.   Chronic granulomatous disease is estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 to 250,000 people worldwide. The prevalence and incidence of NCF4-related CGD is not known.  To date, fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature.  ", "Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life.People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal infections in their lungs. Other common areas of infection in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes.Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with chronic granulomatous disease. Most commonly, granulomas occur in the gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract. In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Additionally, granulomas within the gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses). Inflammation in the stomach can prevent food from passing through to the intestines (gastric outlet obstruction), leading to an inability to digest food. These digestive problems cause vomiting after eating and weight loss. In the genitourinary tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Inflammation of the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) and bone marrow (osteomyelitis), which both produce immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system.Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs.Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of individuals with chronic granulomatous disease; however, with treatment, most affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood."], "alternate_names": ["GRANULOMATOUS

The NNT gene provides instructions for making nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase. This enzyme is found embedded in the inner membrane of mitochondria and is involved in NADPH production.  NADPH is involved in removing reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, proteins and cell membranes. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase is found throughout the body, but it is particularly abundant in the hormone-producing adrenal and thyroid glands, heart, kidneys, and fatty tissue. NNT gene mutations impair the enzyme's ability to produce NADPH, leading to an increase in reactive oxygen species in adrenal gland tissues. Over time, these toxic molecules can impair the function of adrenal gland cells and lead to apoptosis, diminishing the production of glucocorticoids.  This condition is one form of Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency. Familial glucocorticoid deficiency usually presents in infancy or early childhood with hyperpigmentation of the skin and gums (either present at birth or developing over time), hypoglycemic seizures and failure to thrive. Recurrent infections are also a common finding and may be the presenting sign in older children. Weakness, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, flank or abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhea are other symptoms seen in some patients due to hypocortisolemia. Hypoglycemic crises resulting in seizures can lead to coma or death if untreated and recurrent hypoglycemia may lead to neurological sequelae, such as learning disabilities, cognitive impairment and sometimes,  neuronal damage severe enough to cause major sensory and motor defects such as quadriplegia. The prognosis is good for patients with early diagnosis and treatment. Only when left untreated is FGD a disease with high morbidity and mortality.  Treatment consists of replacement therapy with oral hydrocortisone. Treatment normalizes cortisol and reduces, although rarely normalizes levels of ACTH. Dose modification is necessary during periods of stress such as surgery or intercurrent illness.  Patients should have injectable hydrocortisone available for emergencies as well as medical alert type bracelets or cards. Prompt and adequate treatment of a hypoglycemic crisis is essential. Mineralocorticoid treatment is rarely needed in NNT-related Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency, although mineralocorticoid deficiency should be monitored for. Treatment is life-long.  The prevalence of Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency is not known, although variants in NNT are thought to account for about 15% of cases.

Niemann-Pick disease type A occurs more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish descent than in the general population. The incidence within the Ashkenazi population is approximately 1 in 40,000 individuals.Combined, Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are estimated to affect 1 in 150,000 individuals; however, type C1 is by far the more common type, accounting for 95 percent of cases. The disease occurs more frequently in people of French-Acadian descent in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, a population of affected French-Acadians were previously designated as having Niemann-Pick disease type D, however, it was shown that these individuals have mutations in the gene associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C1.", "pattern_of_inheritance": "Autosomal recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Niemann-Pick disease 1 is an autosomal recessive condition caused by variants in the NPC1 gene located on chromosome 18q11.2. The NPC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located within the membrane of lysosomes and endosomes, which digest and recycle materials. While the exact function of this protein is unclear, it plays a role in the movement of cholesterol and other types of lipids within cells and across cell membranes.  More than 380 mutations in the NPC1 gene have been found to cause Niemann-Pick disease type C1. This type of Niemann-Pick disease is characterized by a buildup of fat within cells that leads to movement problems, neurological impairment, lung and liver disease, and speech and feeding problems. Because of impaired movement of cholesterol and other lipids, normal cell functions that require these lipids (such as cell membrane formation) are impaired. In addition, intracellular accumulation of lipids and cholesterol, along with cellular dysfunction, eventually leads to cell death, causing the tissue and organ damage seen in Niemann-Pick disease type C1.  The signs and symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are very similar; these types differ only in their genetic cause. Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 usually become apparent in childhood, although signs and symptoms can develop at any time. People with these types usually develop difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), an inability to move the eyes vertically (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy), poor muscle tone (dystonia), severe liver disease, and interstitial lung disease. Individuals with Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 have problems with speech and swallowing that worsen over time, eventually interfering with feeding. Affected individuals often experience progressive decline in intellectual function and about one-third have seizures. People with these types may survive into adulthood.  There is no cure for NP-C . Treatment of NPC1 is mainly supportive and palliative care aimed at ameliorating neurological symptoms (anti-seizure drugs, anticholinergics for dystonia and tremor, antidepressants/antipsychotics for mood and psychotic disorders). Miglustat has been approved by the EU for treatment and, although not FDA-approved, is available for compassionate use in the US. Miglustat inhibits the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, an essential enzyme for the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. Specific guidelines and criteria have been published for starting miglustat (PMID:29625568): All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC should be considered for miglustat therapy; NPC patients who are presymptomatic or have only spleen/liver enlargement should not be offered miglustat; miglustat should not be started in NPC patients with advanced neurological disease/dementia; miglustat should not be started in NPC patients with another life threatening illness with estimated life span less than 1 year.  Combined, Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are estimated to affect 1 in 150,000 individuals; however, type C1 is by far the more common type, accounting for 95 percent of cases. The disease occurs more frequently in people of French-Acadian descent in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, a population of affected French-Acadians were previously designated as having Niemann-Pick disease type D, however, it was shown that these individuals have mutations in the gene associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C1.  ", "Niemann-Pick disease is a condition that affects many body systems. It has a wide range of symptoms that vary in severity. Niemann-Pick disease is divided into four main types: type A, type B, type C1, and type C2. These types are classified on the basis of genetic cause and the signs and symptoms of the condition.Infants with Niemann-Pick disease type A usually develop an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) by age 3 months and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). The affected children develop normally until around age 1 year when they experience a progressive loss of mental abilities and movement (psychomotor regression). Children with Niemann-Pick disease type A also develop widespread lung damage (interstitial lung disease) that can cause recurrent lung infections and eventually lead to respiratory failure. All affected children have an eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination. Children with Niemann-Pick disease type A generally do not survive past early childhood.Niemann-Pick disease type B usually presents in mid-childhood. The signs and symptoms of this type are similar to type A, but not as severe. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B often have hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent lung infections, and a low number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). They also have short stature and slowed mineralization of bone (delayed bone age). About one-third of affected individuals have the cherry-red spot eye abnormality or neurological impairment. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B usually survive into adulthood.The signs and symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are very similar; these types differ only in their genetic cause. Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 usually become apparent in childhood, although signs and symptoms can develop at any time. People with these types usually develop difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), an inability to move the eyes vertically (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy), poor muscle tone (dystonia), severe liver disease, and interstitial lung disease. Individuals with Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 have problems with speech and swallowing that worsen over time, eventually interfering with feeding. Affected individuals often experience progressive decline in intellectual function and about one-third have seizures.

Variants in 3 other genes, SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G cause a more severe recessive form of pseudohypoaldosteronism with similar presentations but through different mechanisms.  The NR3C2 gene provides instructions for making the mineralocorticoid receptor. This protein is important in regulating the amount of sodium in the body. Sodium regulation plays a role in blood pressure control and fluid balance. Mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone bind to and activate this receptor. The activated mineralocorticoid receptor acts as a transcription factor, regulating transcription of particular genes. The mineralocorticoid receptor regulates sodium and potassium transporter proteins in the cell membrane. In response to signals that sodium levels in the body are low, the mineralocorticoid receptor increases the number and activity of these proteins at the cell membrane, especially in certain kidney cells. One of these proteins transports sodium into the cell, while another protein simultaneously transports sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell. These proteins help keep sodium in the body through reabsorption and remove potassium from the body through secretion.  PHA1 is named for its characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of aldosterone. However, people with PHA1 have high levels of aldosterone. Mutations in the NR3C2 gene lead to a nonfunctional or abnormally functioning mineralocorticoid receptor protein that cannot properly regulate the specialized proteins that transport sodium and potassium.  As a result, sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion are both decreased. More than 50 mutations in the NR3C2 gene have been identified in people with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (renal PHA1).  The earliest signs of PHA1, typically seen in infants, are usually failure to thrive and dehydration. The characteristic features of both types of PHA1 are salt wasting, which leads to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Infants with PHA1 can also develop a metabolic acidosis. Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle weakness in affected infants. Autosomal dominant PHA1 is considered a relatively mild form of the condition that can improve in childhood, unlike the recessive forms of the condition.  Treatment consists of salt and fluid replacement, as well as correction of hyperkalemia and acidosis in the acute phase of the disease. As CAH and HA due to aldosterone deficiency are the major differential diagnoses, fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone replacement therapy are often initiated while confirming the diagnosis by molecular analysis and/or hormonal measurements. Ion exchange resins are also often administered to normalize potassium levels.  The prognosis for patients is good: salt supplementation is usually followed by rapid clinical and biochemical improvement. As renal PHA1 improves with age, treatment can be discontinued at around 18-24 months in the majority of patients.  PHA1 is a rare condition that has been estimated to affect 1 in 80,000 newborns. The exact prevalence of PHA1 caused by variants in NR3C2 is unknown.  ", "Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a condition characterized by problems regulating the amount of sodium in the body. Sodium regulation, which is important for blood pressure and fluid balance, primarily occurs in the kidneys. However, sodium can also be removed from the body through other tissues, such as the sweat glands and colon. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is named for its characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of a hormone called aldosterone that helps regulate sodium levels. However, people with PHA1 have high levels of aldosterone.There are two types of PHA1 distinguished by their severity, the genes involved, and how they are inherited. One type, called autosomal dominant PHA1 (also known as renal PHA1) is characterized by excessive sodium loss from the kidneys. This form of the condition is relatively mild and often improves in early childhood. The other type, called autosomal recessive PHA1 (also known as generalized or systemic PHA1) is characterized by sodium loss from the kidneys and other organs, including the sweat glands, salivary glands, and colon. This type of PHA1 is more severe and does not improve with age.The earliest signs of both types of PHA1 are usually the inability to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and dehydration, which are typically seen in infants. The characteristic features of both types of PHA1 are excessive amounts of sodium released in the urine (salt wasting), which leads to low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia), and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). Infants with PHA1 can also have high levels of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis). Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness in infants with PHA1.Infants with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have additional signs and symptoms due to the involvement of multiple organs. Affected individuals may experience episodes of abnormal heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia) or shock because of the imbalance of salts in the body. They may also have recurrent lung infections or lesions on the skin. Although adults with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have repeated episodes of salt wasting, they do not usually have other signs and symptoms of the condition."], "alternate_names":

Sexual development is usually determined by an individual's chromosomes; however, in Swyer syndrome, sexual development does not match the affected individual's chromosomal makeup.People usually have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Girls and women typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX karyotype), while boys and men usually have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY karyotype). In Swyer syndrome, individuals with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell, the pattern typically found in boys and men, have female reproductive structures.People with Swyer syndrome have typical female external genitalia. The uterus and fallopian tubes are normally-formed, but the gonads (ovaries or testes) are not functional; affected individuals have undeveloped clumps of tissue called streak gonads. Because of the lack of development of the gonads, Swyer syndrome is also called 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. The residual gonadal tissue often becomes cancerous, so it is usually removed surgically early in life.People with Swyer syndrome are typically raised as girls and have a female gender identity. Because they do not have functional ovaries, affected individuals usually begin hormone replacement therapy during adolescence to induce menstruation and development of female secondary sex characteristics such as breast enlargement and uterine growth. Hormone replacement therapy also helps reduce the risk of reduced bone density (osteopenia and osteoporosis). Women with this disorder do not produce eggs (ova), but they may be able to become pregnant with a donated egg or embryo.Swyer syndrome usually affects only sexual development; such cases are called isolated Swyer syndrome.

The OXCT1 gene provides instructions for making succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) The SCOT enzyme is a mitochondrial enzyme essential for ketone body metabolism. Ketones are an important source of energy during prolonged periods of fasting or when energy demands are increased, such as during illness or when exercising. In the processing of ketones, the SCOT enzyme converts acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA. Deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of ketone bodies and ketoacidosis during periods of catabolic stress. Persistent ketosis is a hallmark of this disorder.  Partial loss-of-function mutations have been identified that also lead to severe ketoacidosis, but without permanent ketosis.  Neonatal onset occurs in about half of patients, with the first episode of ketoacidosis occurring within the first 48 to 96 hours of life. Patients with later onset present with an initial episode of ketoacidosis between 6-20 months of age. Initial episodes are often severe.  Further episodes are often triggered by metabolic stress, infection or prolonged periods of fasting. Symptoms include tachypnea, vomiting, lethargy, hypotonia, and, in severe cases, coma. Episode intensity and frequency are variable. Severe episodes are potentially fatal. Patients are generally healthy and develop normally between episodes, but infants may present with failure to thrive and poor feeding. Cardiomegaly has been reported in several cases and may lead to congestive heart failure. Risk of premature death is highest during the neonatal and infantile period due to severe episodes of ketoacidosis. The frequency and severity of ketoacidosis decreases after 10 years of age; thus, beyond this period, life expectancy maybe as good as in the general population. Normal growth and development are expected when proper treatment and diet are followed.    Ketoacidotic crises must be treated immediately with intravenous fluid therapy including enough glucose, even when patients show normo- or hyperglycemia, to suppress ketogenesis. Treatment of metabolic acidosis using sodium bicarbonate is controversial; no controlled studies have been done. Minimal usage of sodium bicarbonate is recommended. Patients must avoid prolonged fasting. A fat-rich diet which induces ketogenesis should be avoided. Protein restriction may not be necessary; the effect of prevention of ketoacidosis is not proven. Home monitoring of urinary ketones can help parents to follow the patient's condition. Dietary modifications should be made under the guidance of a metabolic dietitian familiar with the condition. There is no recommended medication for the chronic phase, although corn starch or modified cornstarch may  improve fasting tolerance.   Carbohydrate-rich food or drink should be provided immediately if ketone levels are higher than usual. If patients become weak or vomit, intravenous glucose infusions should be considered. The use of oral sodium bicarbonate and L-carnitine have been reported in the literature for chronic management, but their effects on prevention of ketoacidosis attacks are unproven. Carnitine is often given to avoid deficiency.  The prevalence of SCOT deficiency is unknown. More than 20 cases of this condition have been reported in the scientific literature.", "Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) deficiency is an inherited disorder that impairs the body's ability to break down ketones, which are molecules produced in the liver during the breakdown of fats.The signs and symptoms of SCOT deficiency typically appear within the first few years of life. Affected individuals experience episodes of extreme tiredness (lethargy), appetite loss, vomiting, rapid breathing, and, occasionally, seizures. These episodes, which are called ketoacidotic attacks, sometimes lead to coma. About half of affected individuals have a ketoacidotic attack within the first 4 days of life. Affected individuals have no symptoms of the disorder between ketoacidotic attacks.People with SCOT deficiency usually have a permanently elevated level of ketones in their blood (persistent ketosis). If the level of ketones gets too high, which can be brought on by infections, fevers, or periods without food (fasting), a ketoacidotic attack can occur.

The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with this disorder, the kidneys do not remove enough acidic compounds from the body. Instead, the acids are absorbed back into the bloodstream, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance, called metabolic acidosis, can result in a range of signs and symptoms that vary in severity. Metabolic acidosis often causes nausea, vomiting, and dehydration; affected infants tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). Most children and adults with renal tubular acidosis with deafness have short stature, and many develop kidney stones.The metabolic acidosis that occurs in renal tubular acidosis with deafness may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. Rarely, people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness have episodes of hypokalemic paralysis, a condition that causes extreme muscle weakness associated with low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia).In people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) usually begins between childhood and young adulthood, and gradually gets worse. An inner ear abnormality affecting both ears occurs in most people with this disorder. This feature, which is called enlarged vestibular aqueduct, can be seen with medical imaging.

If PKU is not treated, phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems.The signs and symptoms of PKU vary from mild to severe. The most severe form of this disorder is known as classic PKU. Infants with classic PKU appear normal until they are a few months old. Without treatment, these children develop permanent intellectual disability. Seizures, delayed development, behavioral problems, and psychiatric disorders are also common. Untreated individuals may have a musty or mouse-like odor as a side effect of excess phenylalanine in the body. Children with classic PKU tend to have lighter skin and hair than unaffected family members and are also likely to have skin disorders such as eczema.Less severe forms of this condition, sometimes called variant PKU and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia, have a smaller risk of brain damage. People with very mild cases may not require treatment with a low-phenylalanine diet.Babies born to mothers who have PKU and uncontrolled phenylalanine levels (women who no longer follow a low-phenylalanine diet) have a significant risk of intellectual disability because they are exposed to very high levels of phenylalanine before birth. These infants may also have a low birth weight and grow more slowly than other children. Other characteristic medical problems include heart defects or other heart problems, an abnormally small head size (microcephaly), and behavioral problems.

Although people with PCD deficiency usually have elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood, this form of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency rarely causes significant medical problems. Researchers believe that other enzymes may compensate for the reduced activity of pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase in people with PCBD1 gene mutations. It is now known that PCBD1 deficiency can also cause diabetes with onset during puberty that responds to treatment with oral medications (sulfonylureas or glibnides). Monitoring of neonatal PCBD1 HPA patients in puberty and later in life for the development of diabetes is recommended.  Treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia in cases of BH4 deficiency is treated with provision of BH4 (sapropterin) and a phenylalanine restricted diet.  PCD deficiency accounts for about 5 percent of all cases of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.

PGM1 encodes a phosphoglucomutase isozyme.  Phosphoglucomutases catalyze the interconversion between glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P),  a branch point in carbohydrate metabolism. It is the predominate isozyme in most cell types, excluding red blood cells,  representing about 90% of total phosphoglucomutase activity. Phosphoglucomutase 1 is involved in several important metabolic pathways, including glycogen metabolism, glycolysis and N-linked glycosylation of proteins.  PGM1-CDG is one subtype of the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). Deficiency enzyme activity disrupts glycolysis, glycogenolysis and glycogenesis. It also blocks protein glycosylation which ultimately affects the function of many proteins that require glycosylation for proper function.  PGM1-CDG is rare and has a wide range of clinical manifestations. PGM1-CDG presents as two major phenotypes: a multisystem form and a primary myopathic form.  The multisystem form presents in infancy with congenital malformations (cleft palate, bifid uvula, cardiac valve anomalies, anal atresia, and vertebral anomalies), variable endocrine and hematological abnormalities, cardiac, muscle, and hepatic involvement. Hyperinsulinism is common.  Neurologic complications (seizures, hypotonia, cognitive impairment, psychomotor impairment) have also been described. In the primary myopathic form, muscular involvement is a predominant feature presenting similarly to that of other muscle glycogenosis with exercise intolerance, fatigability, muscle weakness, and episodes of rhabdomyolysis.  Malignant hyperthermia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with delayed puberty have also been described. Biochemically, abnormal transferrin isoelectric focusing patterns are observed with a loss of complete N-glycans (type 1 pattern) and the presence of incomplete glycans (type 1/ 2 pattern).   Unlike most other congenital disorders of glycosylation, PGM1-CDG has an effective treatment option, D-galactose, which has been shown to improve many of the patients' symptoms. Thus, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment for PGM1-CDG patients are crucial. Other treatments depend on the symptoms and severity in each person, including standard treatment of hypoglycemia,  and/or heart medications or heart transplantation for  cardiomyopathy.  The course of the disorder and how symptoms or complications affect the lifespan are variable and difficult to predict. Management guidelines have been published (PMID 32681750)  PGM1-CDG is very rare: the incidence and prevalence have not been well established.

The PGM3 gene provides instructions for phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3). Phosphoglucomutase 3 is involved in the process of glycosylation. During this process, complex chains of oligosaccharides are added to proteins and lipids. Glycosylation modifies proteins and lipids so they can perform a wider variety of functions. Phosphoglucomutase 3 converts N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate to N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate. This conversion is required to make uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is needed to transfer sugars to growing oligosaccharides during glycosylation.  PGM3-CDG primarily affects the immune system but can also involve other areas of the body. The pattern and severity of this disorder's signs and symptoms typically vary. Most people with PGM3-CDG have an immune deficiency. Many have leukopenia. Because affected individuals lack the necessary immune cells to fight off certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi, they are prone to repeated and persistent infections that often occur in the lungs, ears, skin, or gastrointestinal tract. In severe cases of PGM3-CDG, impaired bone marrow function may lead to a decrease in the production of all blood cells, resulting in bone marrow failure. Affected individuals usually also have allergies, asthma or eczema. People with PGM3-CDG may develop autoimmunity. Persistent illness may cause growth failure in affected children. Additionally, people with PGM3-CDG often have abnormally high levels of immunoglobulins, particularly immunoglobulin E (IgE). The effect of abnormal levels of antibodies in PGM3-CDG is unclear. People with PGM3-CDG often have intellectual disability, delayed development, and hypotonia. Many affected individuals have skeletal abnormalities involving the ribs or bones in the hands, feet, or spine. Some people with this condition have distinct facial features, such as midface hypoplasia, micrognathia, full lips, downturned corners of the mouth, and wide anteverted nostrils. PGM3-CDG can also cause problems in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Lifespan varies widely in people with PGM3-CDG; some do not survive past infancy while others live into late adulthood.  Treatment tends to be supportive. IVIG and prophylactic antimicrobial therapies (mainly antibacterial and antifungal) are often used to prevent infection. G-CSF has shown some efficacy by stimulating granulocyte production. Acute infections are treated with  appropriate antimicrobial agents guided by the identified pathogen and sensitivities. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used to treat immunodeficiency with some success. If severe bronchiectasis or renal failure develop, lung or kidney transplantation may be considered.   PGM3-CDG is a rare disorder, although its prevalence is unknown.

The pattern and severity of this disorder's signs and symptoms typically vary.Most people with PGM3-CDG have impaired immune function (immune deficiency). Many have a shortage of white blood cells (leukopenia), which normally protect the body from infection. Because affected individuals lack the necessary immune cells to fight off certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi, they are prone to repeated and persistent infections that often occur in the lungs, ears, skin, or gastrointestinal tract. In severe cases of PGM3-CDG, impaired bone marrow function may lead to a decrease in the production of all blood cells, resulting in a condition called bone marrow failure. Affected individuals usually also have allergies, asthma, or an inflammatory skin condition called eczema. People with PGM3-CDG may develop autoimmunity, which occurs when the body attacks its own tissues and organs by mistake. Persistent illness may cause affected children to grow more slowly than other individuals.Additionally, people with PGM3-CDG often have abnormally high levels of immune system proteins called antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins), particularly immunoglobulin E (IgE). Antibodies help protect the body against infection by attaching to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. The effect of abnormal levels of antibodies in PGM3-CDG is unclear.People with PGM3-CDG often have intellectual disability, delayed development, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Many affected individuals have skeletal abnormalities involving the ribs or bones in the hands, feet, or spine. Some people with this condition have distinct facial features, such as a flat or sunken appearance of the middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), small chin (micrognathia), full lips, downturned corners of the mouth, and wide nostrils that open to the front rather than downward. PGM3-CDG can also cause problems in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys.Lifespan varies widely in people with PGM3-CDG; some do not survive past infancy while others live into late adulthood."], "alternate_names": ["IMMUNODEFICIENCY 23"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 8907.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "PGM3"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Gastrostomy tube"}, {"int_description_2": "Hemodialysis"}, {"int_description_3": "Nasogastric tube"}, {"int_description_4": "Ventilatory and circulatory support"}, {"int_description_5": "Exclusion of milk, cereals and eggs"}, {"int_description_6": "Doxorubicin"}, {"int_description_7": "Bleomycin"}, {"int_description_8": "Dacarbazine"}, {"int_description_9": "Vinblastine"}, {"int_description_10": "Antimicrobial therapy", "timeframe_int10": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int10": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int10": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug10": "Cohort study or studies", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug10": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_11": "Corticosteroids"}, {"int_description_12": "Emollients"}, {"int_description_13": "Lasix"}, {"int_description_14": "Filgrastim"}, {"int_description_15": "Occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy"}, {"int_description_16": "Orthopedic and physical medicine management (well-supported wheel chairs, appropriate transfer devices for the home, and physical therapy)"}, {"int_description_17": "Platelets transfusions"}, {"int_description_18": "Red blood cells transfusions"}, {"int_description_19": "Bilateral lung transplantation", "timeframe_int19": "Days or Weeks,Years", "age_use_int19": "Infant,Child", "contra_int19": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug19": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug19": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_20": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation"}, {"int_description_21": "Renal transplantation"}, {"int_description_22": "Surgery for skeletal malformations."}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Eleven percent intact PGM3 in a severely immunodeficient patient with a novel splice-site mutation, a case report.", "pmid_1": 30157810.0, "pmid_date_1": 2018.0, "pmid_journal_1": "BMC pediatrics"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Congenital Disorders of N-Linked Glycosylation and Multiple Pathway Overview", "pmid_2": 20301507.0, "pmid_date_2": 2017.0, "pmid_journal_2": "GeneReviews<sup>\u00ae</sup>"}, {"pmid_title_3": "A Novel PGM3 Mutation Is Associated With a Severe Phenotype of Bone Marrow Failure, Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, Skeletal Dysplasia, and Congenital Malformations.", "pmid_3": 28543917.0, "pmid_date_3": 2017.0, "pmid_journal_3": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research"}, {"pmid_title_4": "PGM3 mutations cause a congenital disorder of glycosylation with severe immunodeficiency and skeletal dysplasia.", "pmid_4": 24931394.0, "pmid_date_4": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_4": "American journal of human genetics"}, {"pmid_title_5": "Autosomal recessive phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3) mutations link glycosylation defects to atopy, immune deficiency, autoimmunity, and neurocognitive impairment.", "pmid_5": 24589341.0, "pmid_date_5": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_5": "The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology"}]}, {"_id": "8918-OMIM:307800", "condition": {"condition_name": "HYPOPHOSPHATEMIC RICKETS, X-LINKED DOMINANT", "pattern_of_inheritance": "X-linked dominant, Autosomal dominant, Autosomal recessive, X-linked recessive", "clinical_summary": ["X-linked Dominant Hypophosphatemic Rickets is an X-linked dominant condition caused by variants in the PHEX gene, located on chromosome Xp22. While this condition is unlikely to present in the NICU or PICU, it may be identified as an incidental finding on WES/WGS.  X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common genetic inherited  form of rickets and  affects about 1 in 20,000 newborns.  The basic physiologic defect in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is impairment of renal tubular phosphate resorption caused by reduced expression of sodium-phosphate cotransporters on the apical surface of proximal renal tubule cells. Phosphate plays a critical role in bone  and tooth metabolism in children and adults. The PHEX gene encodes an enzyme that is active primarily in bones and teeth. It is postulated that this enzyme regulates expression of fibroblast growth factor 23 which normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to resorb phosphate in the blood stream, leading to decreased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production. It is unclear how the PHEX enzyme helps to control phosphate reabsorption and what role it plays in bone formation and growth.  In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets begin in early childhood. The features of the disorder vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphatemia without other signs and symptoms. More severely affected children experience slow growth and are shorter than their peers. They develop bone abnormalities that can interfere with movement and cause bone pain. The most noticeable of these abnormalities are bowed legs or knock knees. These abnormalities become apparent with weight-bearing activities such as walking. If untreated, they tend to worsen with time. Other signs and symptoms of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets can include premature craniosynostosis and dental abnormalities. The disorder may also cause abnormal bone growth where ligaments and tendons attach to joints (enthesopathy). In adults, hypophosphatemia is characterized by osteomalacia.  Treatment of XLH focuses on the correction of phosphate levels in the blood and oral vitamin D (calcitriol) therapy to ensure adequate bone growth and development. If diagnosed early, pain and leg bowing typically improve with therapy. Good oral hygiene with flossing and regular dental follow-up is encouraged to prevent dental abscesses. Long-term outcomes are largely dependent on the compliance with therapy although predicted mid-parental heights are usually not reached. There is no evidence that growth hormone treatment is beneficial. Leg deformities may correct with therapy, but orthopedic surgery may be needed. Secondary complications that might develop despite treatment include renal calculi, secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism, hypertension, dental infections/abscesses and electrolyte abnormalities.    Recently burosumab,  a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits FGF23 activity, has become clinically available. In the United States, it has been approved for the treatment of XLH in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older, as well as in adolescents and adults. In clinical trials, pediatric patients treated with burosumab had significantly greater improvements in radiographic healing of rickets, biochemical markers, lower extremity deformities and mobility and pain and greater height improvement was seen. Since renal phosphate wasting is reduced, the complications of nephrocalcinosis and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism are not seen, as can be seen with conventional therapy. It is significantly more expensive than conventional therapy and results of long-term outcome studies are pending.

Different types of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency have been described; they are distinguished by their severity and the age at which symptoms first begin. Most affected individuals have the infantile form, which is the most severe form, and are affected from infancy. Symptoms of the juvenile and adult types appear later in life; these types are very rare.In phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency there is a progressive loss of brain cells leading to a loss of brain tissue (brain atrophy), specifically affecting the fatty tissue known as myelin that surrounds nerve cells (hypomyelination). Frequently, the tissue that connects the two halves of the brain (corpus callosum) is small and thin, and the fluid-filled cavities (ventricles) near the center of the brain are enlarged. Because development of the brain is disrupted, the head does not grow at the same rate as the body, so it appears that the head is getting smaller as the body grows (progressive microcephaly). Poor brain growth leads to an inability to achieve many developmental milestones such as sitting unsupported and speaking. Many affected infants also have difficulty feeding.The seizures in phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency can vary in type. Recurrent muscle contractions called infantile spasms are typical early in the disorder. Without early treatment, seizures may progress to tonic-clonic seizures, which involve a loss of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and convulsions; myoclonic seizures, which involve rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks; or drop attacks, which are sudden episodes of weak muscle tone.Individuals with the infantile form of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency develop many of the features described above. Individuals with the juvenile form typically have epilepsy as well as mild developmental delay and intellectual disability. Only one case of the adult form has been reported; signs and symptoms began in mid-adulthood and included mild intellectual disability; difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia); and numbness, tingling, and pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy)."], "alternate_names": ["PHOSPHOGLYCERATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY; PHGDHD"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 8923.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "PHGDH"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Glycine", "timeframe_int1": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int1": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int1": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug1": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug1": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_2": "Serine", "timeframe_int2": "Hours,Days or Weeks", "age_use_int2": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int2": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug2": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug2": "Effective / Ameliorative"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Infantile Serine Biosynthesis Defect Due to Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase Deficiency: Variability in Phenotype and Treatment Response, Novel Mutations, and Diagnostic Challenges.", "pmid_1": 28135894.0, "pmid_date_1": 2017.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Journal of child neurology"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Abstracts of the Annual Symposium of the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism.

The PIK3R1 gene provides instructions for making a regulatory subunit of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Several slightly different versions of this regulatory subunit are produced from the PIK3R1 gene; the most abundant of these is called p85\u03b1. PI3K is a kinase which is active in phosphorylation of signaling molecules that are important in cell growth and division,  cell migration, protein translation, intracellular transport, and cell survival. It may be involved in regulation of insulin and adipocyte maturation.

This syndrome is reported to have a recognizable facial gestalt consisting of triangular facies, lack of facial fat, and hypoplastic nasal alae with overhanging columella, as well as near-universal partial lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, nephrocalcinosis, and hearing deficits. Treatment is symptomatic and requires a multidisciplinary team. Screening for insulin resistance is recommended starting in mid-late childhood. Glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus can be treated with diet, lifestyle, oral medication and insulin, while growth hormone therapy is contraindicated. Ophthalmological management, including regular eye examinations, is necessary to reduce and stabilize ocular pressures and to preserve vision. Dental anomalies can be treated using standard methods. The prevalence of SHORT syndrome is unknown. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature to date.

This is a rare,  highly phenotypically heterogeneous, early onset genetic, primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by increased susceptibility to recurrent and/or severe bacterial and viral infections (in particular, sinopulmonary bacterial and herpesvirus infections), chronic benign lymphoproliferation (manifesting as lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and focal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia), and/or autoimmune disease (including immune cytopenias, juvenile arthritis, glomerulonephritis and sclerosing cholangitis). Immunophenotypically, variable degrees of agammaglobulinemia with increased IgM levels, increased circulating transitional B cells, decreased na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T-cells with increased CD8 effector/memory T cells are observed. Growth retardation, mild neurodevelopmental delay, and autoimmunity may also be present. The major complication is development of B-cell lymphoma. Treatment regimens for affected patients may include antibiotic prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successful in several patients and may be a treatment option in young patients. Immunosuppressive therapies aimed at reducing lymphoproliferation have included treatment with rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and rapamycin to target the activation of the mTOR pathway. There are no evidence-based treatment protocols for this condition. Exact prevalence and incidence of this condition are not known.   A single family has been identified with a homozygous truncating variant (p.W298X) in the PIK3R1 gene presenting with agammaglobulinemia and absent B lineage cells (Autosomal Recessive Agammaglobulinemia 7). There is no data to suggest this disorder should be managed differently than other agammaglobulinemias: the primary medical treatment being immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

Genetic changes in PIK3R1,  located on chromosome 5q13.1,  appear to lead to at least 3 distinct clinical disorders:Autosomal Recessive Agammaglobulinemia 7, Autosomal Dominant Immunodeficiency 36, and Autosomal Dominant SHORT syndrome . The PIK3R1 gene provides instructions for making a regulatory subunit of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Several slightly different versions of this regulatory subunit are produced from the PIK3R1 gene; the most abundant of these is called p85\u03b1. PI3K is a kinase which is active in phosphorylation of signaling molecules that are important in cell growth and division,  cell migration, protein translation, intracellular transport, and cell survival. It may be involved in regulation of insulin and adipocyte maturation.  A single family has been identified with a homozygous truncating variant (p.W298X) in the PIK3R1 gene presenting with agammaglobulinemia and absent B lineage cells (Autosomal Recessive Agammaglobulinemia 7). There is no data to suggest this disorder should be managed differently than other agammaglobulinemias: the primary medical treatment being immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

This is a rare,  highly phenotypically  heterogeneous, early onset genetic, primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by increased susceptibility to recurrent and/or severe bacterial and viral infections (in particular, sinopulmonary bacterial and herpesvirus infections), chronic benign lymphoproliferation (manifesting as lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and focal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia), and/or autoimmune disease (including immune cytopenias, juvenile arthritis, glomerulonephritis and sclerosing cholangitis). Immunophenotypically, variable degrees of agammaglobulinemia with increased IgM levels, increased circulating transitional B cells, decreased na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T-cells with increased CD8 effector/memory T cells are observed. Growth retardation, mild neurodevelopmental delay, and autoimmunity may also be present. The major complication is development of B-cell lymphoma. Treatment regimens for affected patients may include antibiotic prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successful in several patients and may be a treatment option in young patients. Immunosuppressive therapies aimed at reducing lymphoproliferation have included treatment with rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and rapamycin to target the activation of the mTOR pathway.

recessive", "clinical_summary": ["Mutations in AVPR2 (chromosome Xq28) usually cause X-linked recessive hereditary diabetes insipidus; however, at least two 'gain-of-function' mutations in the AVPR2 gene have been found to cause another kidney disorder known as nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD). This condition is characterized by hyponatremia, which can lead to brain swelling and other serious complications. NSIAD also causes the blood to be abnormally dilute (serum hypo-osmolality). NSIAD is an X-linked disorder, affecting mainly males, with females often being asymptomatic carriers (only 3 cases of symptomatic hyponatremic females have been reported).  The two AVPR2 gene mutations associated with NSIAD each change a single amino acid at position 137 in the vasopressin V2 receptor protein. One of these mutations replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid cysteine (p.Arg137Cys or p.R137C); the other mutation replaces arginine with the amino acid leucine (p.Arg137Leu or p.R137L). These mutations lead to a receptor protein that is constitutively activated, even in the absence of ADH. As a result, in the kidneys large amounts of water are reabsorbed into the bloodstream regardless of fluid intake, and the urine is highly concentrated. These abnormalities disrupt the body's water balance, causing hyponatremia and serum hypo-osmolality. In symptomatic NSIAD patients with hyponatremia, rapid management with fluid restriction and, administration of 30-50% oral urea solution, is necessary to avoid persistent or increased hyponatremia, which carries the risk of brain damage.  Treatment of NSIAD is lifelong. Fluid restriction is the cornerstone of treatment. It is generally sufficient to avoid episodes of hyponatremia and is well tolerated. There is a concern of restricting fluids in young infants due to the risk of malnutrition. Oral urea is the second step of treatment and acts by increasing free water clearance (osmotic diuresis). It is safe and well tolerated in children and adults, even over long-term use. Intermittent urea intake (non-daily) can be an option in some patients.

The AVPR2 gene, located on chromosome Xq28, provides instructions for making a protein known as the vasopressin V2 receptor. This receptor works together with a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the kidneys. The vasopressin V2 receptor is found in collecting ducts, which are a series of small tubes that reabsorb water from the kidneys into the bloodstream. The interaction between ADH and the vasopressin V2 receptor triggers chemical reactions that control the body's water balance. When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the body produces more ADH. This hormone binds to the vasopressin V2 receptor and directs the kidneys to concentrate urine by reabsorbing some of the water back into the bloodstream. When fluid intake is adequate, less ADH is available to interact with the vasopressin V2 receptor. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.  Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water balance. The body normally balances fluid intake with the excretion of fluid in urine. Without functional vasopressin V2 receptors, the kidneys are unable to respond to signals from ADH. As a result, collecting ducts do not reabsorb water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Individuals with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus have polyuria, which causes them to be excessively thirsty (polydipsia). If they do not drink enough water, particularly when they are ill or in hot weather, they quickly become dehydrated.Infants with hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may eat poorly and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They may also be irritable and experience fevers, diarrhea, and vomiting. Recurrent episodes of dehydration can lead to slow growth and delayed development. If the condition is not well-managed, over time it can damage the bladder and kidneys leading to pain, infections, and kidney failure. With appropriate treatment, affected individuals usually have few complications and a normal lifespan. In the NICU, treatment revolves around provision of water as 5% dextrose in water, sodium restriction, thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs +/- amiloride (potassium sparing diuretic).  The prevalence of X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is unknown, although the condition is thought to be rare.   ", "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water balance.

Affected individuals can quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water, especially in hot weather or when they are sick.Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be either acquired or hereditary. The acquired form is brought on by certain drugs and chronic diseases and can occur at any time during life. The hereditary form is caused by genetic mutations, and its signs and symptoms usually become apparent within the first few months of life.Infants with hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may eat poorly and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive).

Fully penetrant biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) variants in PKD1 are predicted to be incompatible with live birth; however,  rare reports exist of cases where a pathogenic variant and a hypomorphic variant  or homozygosity/compound heterozygosity for hypomorphic alleles have been reported: these cases present with a more severe neonatal onset form of disease requiring more intensive interventions. Contiguous gene deletions in this region of chromosome 16p13.3 that include both the TSC2 gene and the PKD1 gene can also cause Tuberous Sclerosis/Polycystic Kidney Disease Contiguous Gene Syndrome with early-onset and severe polycystic kidney disease with various manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. A similar phenotype to ADPKD1 is seen in the autosomal dominant condition Polycystic Kidney Disease 2 With or Without Polycystic Liver Disease cause by variants in the PKD2 gene (ADPKD2).    The PKD1 gene provides instructions for making polycystin-1, a protein that is most active in kidney cells before birth; much less of the protein is made in normal adult kidneys. Polycystin-1 spans the cell membrane of kidney cells. When the extracellular domain interacts with other proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, the intracellular domain interacts with another protein, polycystin-2 (a smaller similar protein encoded by the PKD2 gene) which triggers a cascade of chemical reactions within the cell. Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 work together to regulate cell proliferation, migration and cell-cell interactions. Polycystin-1 is also found in primary cilia that are found within the renal tubules. It is thought that these cilia sense fluid movement which is important for maintenance of tubule size and structure. Again, the interaction between polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 likely promotes normal kidney development and function. Although it is not completely clear how a lack of polycystin-1 leads to the formation of cysts, it is thought that changes in polycystin-1 probably disrupt the protein's signaling function within the cell and in primary cilia. As a result, abnormal growth and division of cells lining the renal tubules may lead to the development of numerous cysts that are characteristic of polycystic kidney disease. Clusters of often thousands of cysts in the kidney interfere with the kidney's ability to filter waste products from the blood. Growth of cysts result in kidney enlargement and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver.    Individuals with the autosomal dominant forms of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. In rare cases, enlarged kidneys have been detected in utero. The typical age of onset is in middle life, although symptoms can present any time from infancy to the 8th decade of life.  Approximately 2-5% of cases present before 15 years of age. The cardinal manifestations of ADPKD caused by variants in PKD1 include renal cysts, liver cysts and intracranial or aortic aneurysms, rupture of which can be life-threatening. Clinical symptoms, including early-onset hypertension, abdominal fullness and pain, hematuria and urinary tract infections, are usually observed decades before the onset of renal insufficiency. Up to a third of adult patients have nephrolithiasis. Extra-renal features often include polycystic liver disease, cardiovascular abnormalities (left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic root dilatation, arterial aneurysms, heart valve abnormalities and intracranial aneurysms), bronchiectasis, seminal vesicle cysts, pancreatic cysts, and diverticulosis. Male infertility has been described. Renal insufficiency is slowly progressive with end-stage renal disease occurring in about 50% of patients by the age of 60.     Consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of this condition in children and young people have been developed and published on behalf of the Network for Early Onset Cystic Kidney Disease (NEOCYST)  and have been endorsed by the International Nephrology Association and the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (PMID 31118499). The risk of hypertension in patients <19 years of age is ~20%. First-line treatment for hypertension with or without albuminuria is with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and should be started if blood pressure is repeatedly above the 90% for age or if >130/72 for those 16 and older. Diuretics should be used with caution as they may raise vasopressin levels and have a deleterious effect on eGFR. Proteinuria/albuminuria is a marker of tubulointerstitial damage and fibrosis and, although not associated with hypertension, does respond to treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. The use of other pharmacologic interventions is less clear. There is no evidence for a beneficial effect of statins in children. Vasopressin analogs, as used to treat nocturnal enuresis, should be avoided as they may result in cyst growth and decreased eGFR. mTOR inhibitors should not be used. Their use has been associated with worsening proteinuria, hyperlipidemia and cytopenia. Somatostatin analogs may be beneficial in cases of severe liver disease, which is uncommon in children, and there is insufficient evidence from studies in adults to support their use.     Tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, has been shown to reduce the rates of growth in total kidney volume and renal function loss in adult ADPKD patients, but also leads to polyuria because of its aquaretic effect. There is currently no evidence that tolvaptan is effective in children and no safety studies have been completed to date.  It is currently approved for patients >18 years of age and specific usage recommendations have been published (PMID 26908832). It is not recommended that tolvaptan be routinely offered to children, although off-label use can be considered at clinician discretion in cases where there is a high risk of early progression based on large total kidney volume and/or rapid kidney growth.  There is one report in the literature of its successful use in an infant with severe disease related to compound heterozygosity for a pathogenic variant and a hypomorphic variant in PKD1 (PMID 28194574).    Lifestyle interventions include maintenance of normal weight, recommended daily salt intake that is appropriate for healthy children, protein intake appropriate for age and avoidance of dehydration. Abdominal pain, although common in ADPKD, may not be related to PKD in children and merits a normal pediatric work-up. There are no studies that suggest an increased incidence of complicated or prolonged urinary tract infection in affected children. Routine work-up and treatment of UTI is indicated. If fever is present, pyelonephritis or cyst infection should be considered. Treatment of infected cysts requires long-term antibiotic therapy. Cyst drainage is only necessary for refractory infections as identification of specific infected cysts may be difficult. Tranexamic acid has been used to treat hematuria and/or cyst hemorrhage in adults but has not been tested in children. Nephrolithiasis is very rare in children and, if present, is treated with high fluid intake and symptomatic treatment. Liver cysts are very rare in children (<5%) and no severe cases have been described. Treatment strategies for intracranial aneurysms are controversial and rupture is exceedingly rare in childhood. Recommendations for screening in children should be individualized and is recommended only if additional risk factors are identified (positive family history of aneurysm, previous aneurysm). Kidney transplantation is reserved for those with end-stage renal disease, which is rare in children.   Polycystic kidney disease is a fairly common genetic disorder. It affects about 500,000 people in the United States. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease affects 1 in 500 to 1,000 people. About 78% of patients with ADPKD have variants in PKD1 and about 15% have variants in PKD2.  The remaining ~7% of cases are genetically unresolved or are due to mutations in other recently identified genes (GANAB, DNAJB11,ALG9) involved in the maturation and trafficking of the polycystins. A positive family history is absent in about 10-15% of patients.  ", "Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs.

Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step of glycolysis wherein a phosphate group is moved from phosphoenol pyruvate to adenosine diphosphate, with subsequent production of pyruvate and ATP. This step of glycolysis is irreversible.  Pyruvate kinase deficiency affects red blood cells.  Deficiency of pyruvate kinase causes a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells undergo premature hemolysis, resulting in anemia. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a common cause of hereditary nonspherocytic anemia. In hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, the red blood cells do not assume a spherical shape as they do in some other forms of hemolytic anemia. Chronic hemolytic anemia can lead to pallor, jaundice, fatigue, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Splenomegaly, iron overload and pigment gallstones are also common in this disorder. Onset of symptoms is usually in infancy, although there is variable severity, and the condition may not be diagnosed until later. Hemolytic anemia and associated complications may range from mild to severe. Some affected individuals have few or no symptoms. Severe cases can be life-threatening in infancy, and such affected individuals may require regular blood transfusions to survive. The symptoms of this disorder may worsen during an infection or pregnancy.  The mainstay of treatment is blood transfusion and, in severe cases, splenectomy. Red cell transfusions should be symptom-directed and not based on a hemoglobin threshold. Splenectomy should be based on the patient's ability to tolerate the anemia. As a result of splenectomy, transfusion needs are reduced in many patients. Splenectomy is often accompanied by a considerable increase in reticulocyte counts. Splenectomy should, however, be avoided if bone marrow transplantation is being considered. Supportive care can include gallbladder monitoring due to risk of gallstones. Cholecystectomy is pursued in individuals with symptomatic gallstones and in individuals at the time of splenectomy, if this treatment option is pursued. Folic acid supplementation, which supports increased red cell production, is often prescribed. Vitamin D, calcium, and exercise may be important for bone health. Bone marrow transplantation can cure pyruvate kinase deficiency but is rarely performed. New therapies are under active investigation.  Mitapivat, a small molecule activator therapy, is currently in clinical trials in adults. Lentiviral gene therapy is also actively being investigated(NCT04105166) but is not clinically available.

The POR gene is located on chromosome 7q11.23.  The Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS) is an exceptionally rare craniosynostosis syndrome, presenting in the perinatal period with radiohumeral synostosis along with a wide spectrum of other congenital anomalies which may include midface hypoplasia, choanal stenosis or atresia, multiple joint contractures, visceral anomalies (particularly of the genitourinary system), and impaired steroidogenesis (present only in patients with POR mutations).  ABS can be cause by variants in either FGFR2 or POR genes. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia without Antley-Bixler skeletal anomalies can also result from POR mutations. Mortality in ABS has been reported to be as high as 80% in the neonatal period, primarily due to airway compromise, and prognosis improves with increasing age. The POR gene provides instructions for the synthesis of enzyme cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. This enzyme is required for the normal functioning of more than 50 enzymes in the cytochrome P450 family. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the synthesis and metabolism of various molecules and chemicals within cells. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are critical for the synthesis of cholesterol and steroid hormones. Cholesterol serves many essential functions both before and after birth, including roles in the production of steroid hormones and in the formation and growth of bones. Steroid hormones are needed for normal development and reproduction. This group of hormones includes testosterone and estrogen, which are essential for normal sexual development and reproduction; corticosteroids, which are involved in the body's response to stress; and aldosterone, which helps regulate the body's salt and water balance. Additionally, cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the liver metabolism of some ingested substances. Because cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase helps regulate the activity of these enzymes, researchers suspect that normal variations in the POR gene may influence drug metabolism.  Signs and symptoms of Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency are usually  present at birth or may become apparent in early childhood. The signs and symptoms of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency vary from mild to severe, with ABS1 being on the more severe end of the spectrum. Signs and symptoms of mild cases can include primary amenorrhea, infertility in both men and women, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Individuals with moderate cases of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency may have ambiguous genitalia, and they may have infertility. Individuals with moderate cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency usually do not have skeletal abnormalities. The severe form of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is sometimes called Antley-Bixler syndrome with genital anomalies and disordered steroidogenesis. Hormonal changes in affected males and females lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia or other genital abnormalities, as well as infertility. Severe cases are also characterized by skeletal abnormalities, particularly involving bones of the head and face. These include craniosynostosis, a flattened mid-face, a prominent forehead, and low-set ears. Other skeletal abnormalities can include joint contractures; arachnodactyly; bowing of the thigh bones; and radiohumeral synostosis. Choanal atresia, intellectual disability, and delayed development are also associated with the severe form of the disorder. Some women who are pregnant with fetuses affected by cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency experience mild symptoms of the disorder even though they themselves do not have the disorder. They may develop hirsutism, acne, and a deep voice. These changes go away soon after delivery.  Treatment is symptomatic and includes early neurosurgical as well as pulmonary and orthopedic management. There is no cure for the condition. Most treatments are supportive and aimed at managing specific symptoms seen in each individual.  Surgical procedures performed depend upon the severity of the skeletal problems and associated symptoms. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy, including stress-dose coverage during intercurrent illness, is needed for cortisol deficiency. Dihydrotestosterone treatment has been successful in some males with micropenis. Testosterone replacement in males with low testosterone levels after onset of puberty and estrogen replacement in females with absent pubertal development may be indicated. Estradiol may be used to reduce the size of ovarian cysts, if present. Early intervention (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy) may be important in ensuring that affected children reach their potential.   The prevalence of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is unknown. About 65 cases have been reported worldwide. It is suspected that cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is underdiagnosed and that mild cases of this disorder may be relatively common. Because the signs and symptoms can be difficult to detect, people with mild cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency may never come to medical attention.  Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS) has been described in more than 100 patients. The relative prevalence of the two main etiologies is unknown but cases due to FGFR2 variants seem rarer than those due to POR variants.

pathogenic variants in the PROP1 gene located on chromosome 5q35.3. The PROP1 gene encodes a transcription factor that is found only in the pituitary gland. This protein plays a critical role in the proper development and differentiation of somatotrophs, lactotrophs, thyrotrophs, and gonadotrophs. At least 25 mutations in the PROP1 gene have been found to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency, with the most common being a deletion of two base pairs, 301-302delAG.    PROP1-related combined pituitary hormone deficiency usually presents in infancy or early childhood with growth failure and failure to thrive, related to growth hormone deficiency. In addition to growth hormone deficiency, individuals with PROP1 deficiency may have thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), lueteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin deficiencies. In some cases, there may also be deficiency of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Hypothyroidism, with onset in later infancy and childhood, is usually mild.  Affected individuals may have absent or delayed/incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics and infertility. Untreated males usually have small testes and a small penis. Females may experience menarche but will require subsequent hormone replacement therapy. Uncommonly, affected patients will have ACTH deficiency that presents in adolescence or adulthood.  The prevalence of combined pituitary hormone deficiency is estimated to be 1 in 8,000 individuals worldwide. Mutations in the PROP1 gene are the most common known cause of this disorder, accounting for an estimated 12 to 55 percent of cases.  ", "Combined pituitary hormone deficiency is a condition that causes a shortage (deficiency) of several hormones produced by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. A lack of these hormones may affect the development of many parts of the body. The first signs of this condition include a failure to grow at the expected rate and short stature that usually becomes apparent in early childhood.People with combined pituitary hormone deficiency may have hypothyroidism, which is underactivity of the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland in the lower neck. Hypothyroidism can cause many symptoms, including weight gain and fatigue. Other features of combined pituitary hormone deficiency include delayed or absent puberty and lack the ability to have biological children (infertility). The condition can also be associated with a deficiency of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol deficiency can impair the body's immune system, causing individuals to be more susceptible to infection.Rarely, people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency have intellectual disability; a short, stiff neck; or underdeveloped optic nerves, which carry visual information from the eyes to the brain."], "alternate_names": ["PITUITARY HORMONE DEFICIENCY, COMBINED, 2; CPHD2"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 9455.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "PROP1"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Ventilation"}, {"int_description_2": "Testosterone"}, {"int_description_3": "Testosterone enanthate"}, {"int_description_4": "Calcium"}, {"int_description_5": "Quinagolide"}, {"int_description_6": "Bromocriptine"}, {"int_description_7": "Conjugated estrogens"}, {"int_description_8": "Ethinylestradiol"}, {"int_description_9": "Levothyroxine"}, {"int_description_10": "Estradiol"}, {"int_description_11": "Prasterone sulfate"}, {"int_description_12": "Menotropins"}, {"int_description_13": "Somatotropin"}, {"int_description_14": "Vitamin D"}, {"int_description_15": "Dydrogesterone"}, {"int_description_16": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"int_description_17": "Hydrocortisone acetate"}, {"int_description_18": "Chorionic Gonadotropin (Human)"}, {"int_description_19": "Androgens", "timeframe_int19": "Hours", "age_use_int19": "Neonate", "contra_int19": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug19": "Case report(s)", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug19": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_20": "Birth control pills"}, {"int_description_21": "Glucocorticoid therapy"}, {"int_description_22": "Glucose, 5%"}, {"int_description_23": "Gonadotropin replacement"}, {"int_description_24": "Hypertonic saline"}, {"int_description_25": "Recombinant gonadotropin"}, {"int_description_26": "Sex steroid replacement therapy"}, {"int_description_27": "Iodine"}, {"int_description_28": "Transphenoidal operation"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "Therapy-Induced Growth and Sexual Maturation in a Developmentally Infantile Adult Patient with a PROP1 Mutation.", "pmid_1": 29180983.0, "pmid_date_1": 2017.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Frontiers in endocrinology"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Molecular screening of a large cohort of Moroccan patients with congenital hypopituitarism.", "pmid_2": 25557026.0, "pmid_date_2": 2015.0, "pmid_journal_2": "Clinical endocrinology"}, {"pmid_title_3": "<i>PROP1</i>-Related Combined Pituitary Hormone Deficiency", "pmid_3": 20301521.0, "pmid_date_3": 2014.0, "pmid_journal_3": "GeneReviews\u00ae"}, {"pmid_title_4": "Clinical Case Seminar.

Several of these enzymes are required for synthesis of neurotransmitters. Accumulation of phenylalanine and toxic metabolites leads to central nervous system damage. In addition to causing hyperphenylalaninemia, deficiency also causes neurotransmitter deficiencies related to deficiencies of dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.

Several genes are known to cause BH4 deficiency, including mutations in QDPR located on chromosome 4p15.32. The QDPR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called quinoid dihydropteridine reductase. This enzyme helps carry out one step in the chemical pathway that recycles tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Deficiency of this enzyme, known as dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.   Tetrahydrobiopterin plays a critical role, as a cofactor, in several processes in the body. It works with the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine. It is also involved in reactions that produce neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. When tetrahydrobiopterin interacts with enzymes during chemical reactions, the cofactor is altered and must be recycled to a usable form. Quinoid dihydropteridine reductase is one of two enzymes that help recycle tetrahydrobiopterin in the body.  More than 30 mutations in the QDPR gene have been found to cause tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. When BH4 deficiency results from QDPR gene mutations, it is known as dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency. Deficiency of this enzyme results in improper recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin. As a result, this cofactor is not available to participate in chemical reactions such as the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. If phenylalanine is not converted to tyrosine, it can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues. Nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, which is why excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage. Additionally, a reduction in DHPR activity disrupts the production of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Because neurotransmitters are necessary for normal brain function, changes in the levels of these brain chemicals contribute to intellectual disability in people with DHPR deficiency.  Infants with tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency appear normal at birth, but medical problems ranging from mild to severe become apparent over time. Signs and symptoms of this condition can include intellectual disability, progressive problems with development, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, seizures, behavioral problems, and an inability to control body temperature.  Dihydropteridine reductase deficiency can be treated with a low phenylalanine diet and provision of synthetic BH4 as sapropterin plus L-dopa, carbidopa, leucovorin and 5-hydroxytryptophan. Lower dosages of L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan are possible when given with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, Selegiline or the COMT inhibitor, Entacapone, thus reducing the side effects related to the use of these medications.    BH4 deficiency is rare, affecting an estimated 1 in 500,000 to 1 in 1 million newborns.

Although the Rab27a protein is found in cells throughout the body, its major function is in melanocytes and T-lymphocytes. In melanocytes the Rab27a protein helps transport melanosomes. These structures produce melanin. Rab27a interacts with two other proteins produced by the MLPH and MYO5A genes (mutations in which cause Griscelli Syndrome 1 and 3, respectively) to form a complex that transports melanosomes to the outer edges of melanocytes, allowing for transfer to other cell types where they provide the pigment needed for normal hair, skin and eye coloring.

Affected individuals are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be serious or life-threatening. Infants with Omenn syndrome typically present with recurrent pneumonia and chronic diarrhea, often caused by opportunistic infections. In addition, children with Omenn syndrome suffer from autoimmunity that results in erythroderma, alopecia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Enlargement of the thymus and generalized lymphadenopathy are also present. If not treated such that immune function is restored, children with Omenn syndrome usually only survive until 1-2 years of age.

", "Omenn syndrome is an inherited disorder of the immune system (immunodeficiency). Omenn syndrome is one of several forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a group of disorders that cause individuals to have virtually no immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Individuals with SCID are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. Infants with Omenn syndrome typically experience pneumonia and chronic diarrhea. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with this disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people.In addition to immunodeficiency, children with Omenn syndrome develop autoimmunity, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. This abnormal immune reaction can cause very red skin (erythroderma), hair loss (alopecia), and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). In addition, affected individuals have enlargement of tissues that produce infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes. These include the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone, and lymph nodes, which are found throughout the body.If not treated in a way that restores immune function, children with Omenn syndrome usually survive only until age 1 or 2."], "alternate_names": ["SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, T CELL-NEGATIVE, B CELL-NEGATIVE, NK CELL-POSITIVE", "OMENN

These cells have cell surface antigens that recognize foreign invaders and help protect the body from infection. These proteins must be diverse to be able to recognize a wide variety of substances. The genes from which these proteins are made contain segments known as variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments. During protein production within lymphocytes, these gene segments are rearranged in different combinations to increase variability of the resulting proteins. The RAG complex is involved in V(D)J recombination allowing for myriad V,D and J segment rearrangements and greater recognition of foreign invaders by the body's immune system.  Combined cellular and humoral immune defects with granulomas is a rare, genetic, non-severe combined immunodeficiency disease with T- and B-cell lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, abnormal antibody production and impaired T-cell function. Depending on the residual activity of the RAG proteins the disease can be more or less severe. More severe cases present in infancy. In less severe cases symptoms are milder and may appear later in life, typically in childhood.  It is characterized by immunodeficiency-related recurrent and/or severe bacterial and viral infections, destructive noninfectious granulomas and autoimmune manifestations. Granulomas involve the skin, mucosa and internal organs. Autoimmune manifestations include cytopenias, vitiligo, psoriasis, anemia, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myasthenia gravis and inflammatory bowel disease.  Initial treatment is based on immunosuppressive drugs including prednisone and cyclosporin followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunoglobulin infusions and antibacterial/antifungal prophylaxis have been used for interim management.  The reported combined incidence of combined immunodeficiencies is 1:100,000 to 1:5000 live births worldwide. Prevalence and incidence of combined cellular and humoral immune defects with granulomas are not known.

Individuals with SCID are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. Infants with Omenn syndrome typically experience pneumonia and chronic diarrhea. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with this disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people.In addition to immunodeficiency, children with Omenn syndrome develop autoimmunity, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. This abnormal immune reaction can cause very red skin (erythroderma), hair loss (alopecia), and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). In addition, affected individuals have enlargement of tissues that produce infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes. These include the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone, and lymph nodes, which are found throughout the body.If not treated in a way that restores immune function, children with

Mutations in the RFXANK gene are the most common genetic cause of an immune system disorder known as bare lymphocyte syndrome type II (BLS II). The RFXANK protein is part of a group of proteins called the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex. This complex attaches to a specific region of DNA involved in the regulation of major histocompatibility (MHC)  class II gene activity. RFXANK helps the complex attach to the correct region of DNA. The RFX complex attracts other necessary proteins to this region and helps turn on MHC class II gene transcription, allowing production of MHC class II proteins. MHC class II proteins are found on the surface of several types of immune cells, including lymphocytes, that are involved in immune reactions and play an important role in the body's immune response to foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The RFX complex also appears to play a role in the transcription of MHC class I genes, which provide instructions for making immune system proteins called MHC class I proteins.  Bare lymphocyte syndrome type II (BLS II) is an inherited disorder of the immune system categorized as a form of combined immunodeficiency (CID). People with BLS II lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. These infections are often caused by opportunistic organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system. BLS II is typically diagnosed in the first year of life. Most affected infants have persistent infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts. Because of the infections, affected infants have difficulty absorbing nutrients (malabsorption), and they grow more slowly than their peers. Eventually, the persistent infections lead to organ failure. Without treatment, individuals with BLS II usually do not survive past early childhood. In people with BLS II, lymphocytes do not express MHC class II proteins on their surface, which is where the condition got its name. Because BLS II is the most common and best studied form of a group of related conditions, it is often referred to as simply bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS).  Treatment includes aggressive treatment of infections with appropriate antibiotics, prophylactic antimicrobial therapy (antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial), nutritional support and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Because BLS II is the most common and best studied form of a group of related conditions, it is often referred to as simply bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS)."], "alternate_names": ["BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II"]}, "gene information": {"db_hgnc_gene_id": 9987.0, "db_hgnc_gene_symbol": "RFXANK"}, "interventions": [{"int_description_1": "Mechanical ventilation"}, {"int_description_2": "Nasogastric feeding"}, {"int_description_3": "Oxygen treatment"}, {"int_description_4": "Nutritional rehabilitation"}, {"int_description_5": "Ganciclovir"}, {"int_description_6": "Human immunoglobulin G"}, {"int_description_7": "Antithymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit)"}, {"int_description_8": "Rituximab"}, {"int_description_9": "Alemtuzumab"}, {"int_description_10": "Cyclosporine"}, {"int_description_11": "Amphotericin B"}, {"int_description_12": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"int_description_13": "Busulfan"}, {"int_description_14": "Thiotepa"}, {"int_description_15": "Azithromycin"}, {"int_description_16": "Clindamycin"}, {"int_description_17": "Trimethoprim"}, {"int_description_18": "Sulfamethoxazole"}, {"int_description_19": "Amoxicillin"}, {"int_description_20": "Ceftriaxone"}, {"int_description_21": "Treosulfan"}, {"int_description_22": "Fluconazole"}, {"int_description_23": "Fludarabine"}, {"int_description_24": "Vancomycin"}, {"int_description_25": "Acyclovir"}, {"int_description_26": "Methylprednisolone"}, {"int_description_27": "Anti-LFA1 with or without CD2"}, {"int_description_28": "Antibiotics"}, {"int_description_29": "Antithymocyte globulin"}, {"int_description_30": "Antiviral pharmacotherapy"}, {"int_description_31": "Corticosteroids", "timeframe_int31": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int31": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int31": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug31": "Cohort study or studies", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug31": "Effective / Ameliorative"}, {"int_description_32": "Steroids"}, {"int_description_33": "Physiotherapy"}, {"int_description_34": "Virus-specific, donor-derived T-cell infusion"}, {"int_description_35": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation"}, {"int_description_36": "Placement of a pericardial window", "timeframe_int36": "Days or Weeks", "age_use_int36": "Neonate,Infant,Child", "contra_int36": "No", "qualscale_reclass_drug36": "Cohort study or studies", "rev1_eff_reclass_drug36": "Curative"}, {"int_description_37": "Splenectomy"}, {"int_description_38": "Trans-tympanic drain"}], "references": [{"pmid_title_1": "A novel mutation in RFXANK gene and low B cell count in a patient with MHC class II deficiency: a case report.", "pmid_1": 32578129.0, "pmid_date_1": 2020.0, "pmid_journal_1": "Immunol Res"}, {"pmid_title_2": "Enterovirus-Related Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) Following Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation in an MHC Class II-Deficient Child.", "pmid_2": 28508932.0, "pmid_date_2": 2017.0, "pmid_journal_2": "J Clin Immunol"}, {"pmid_title_3": "Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II Deficiency due to a Novel Mutation in RFXANK in a Child of Mexican Descent.", "pmid_3": 26634365.0, "pmid_date_3": 2016.0, "pmid_journal_3": "J Clin Immunol"}, {"pmid_title_4": "Clinical, immunological and genetic findings of a large tunisian series of major histocompatibility complex class II deficiency patients.", "pmid_4": 23314770.0, "pmid_date_4": 2013.0, "pmid_journal_4": "J Clin Immunol"}, {"pmid_title_5": "Clinical, immunological and genetic features in eleven Algerian patients with major histocompatibility complex class II expression deficiency.", "pmid_5": 22863278.0, "pmid_date_5": 2012.0, "pmid_journal_5": "Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol"}, {"pmid_title_6": "Major histocompatibility complex class II expression deficiency caused by a RFXANK founder mutation: a survey of 35 patients.", "pmid_6": 21908431.0, "pmid_date_6": 2011.0, "pmid_journal_6": "Blood"}, {"pmid_title_7": "The 752delG26 mutation in the RFXANK gene associated with major histocompatibility complex class II deficiency: evidence for a founder effect in the Moroccan population.", "pmid_7": 20414676.0, "pmid_date_7": 2010.0, "pmid_journal_7": "Eur J Pediatr"}]}]}
